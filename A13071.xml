         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>THE FIRST DIVISION, OF THE certaintie of Death.</head>
               <p>THis firſt Diuiſion containing the certaintie of death, is properly ſubdiuided into three parts: The firſt is into the death (which is naturall) of the bodie: the ſecond is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall death of the ſoule in ſinne: and the third is the eternall death of both body and ſoule in hell.</p>
               <p>To theſe three deaths are oppoſed three liues, the life of Nature, of Grace, and of Glorie.</p>
               <p>Naturall or bodily death, which is called the firſt, (becauſe in reſpect of time, it goeth before the third in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) is a diſſolution or ſeparation of the ſoule from the bodie for a time, namely vntill the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The ſpirituall death which is termed the ſecond, is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſeparation of the ſoule principally, but conſequently of body and ſoule from God; of which, Sinne is the mother, the Diuell is the father, and Damnation is the daughter; and this is when men die not to ſinne, but in ſinne.</p>
               <p>Eternall death is the hire and wages of the ſecond, and this euer followes the reprobate after the firſt.</p>
               <p>Both theſe latter are a ſeparation of the whole man, bodie and ſoule from the fellowſhip of God: The firſt is an entrance to death, the ſecond and third are the accompliſhment of it. The firſt is temporarie, the ſecond and third are ſpirituall and eternall. The firſt is of the body onely, the ſecond and third are of both bodie and ſoule. The firſt is common to all men, the ſecond and third are proper only to the Reprobates. But touching the naturall and bodily death, which is the proper
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1365:5"/> ſubiect of this Diuiſion, it is (as we haue ſaid before) the ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſoule from the bodie, with the diſſolution of the bodie vntill the reſurrection, as a puniſhment ordained of God, and impoſed on man for ſinne, though to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the nature of it is chaunged. For when God had ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, a place of pleaſure, giuing him ſuch li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, as theſe words import, <hi>Thou ſhalt eate freely of euery tree of the garden;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.16.17.</note> yet left hee ſhould preſumptuouſly equall himſelfe with his Creator, he gaue him this bridle to champe on, <hi>But of the tree of knowledge of good and euill thou ſhalt not eat, for in that day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt die the death. Adam</hi> had ſoone forgotten this ſaying <hi>(thou ſhalt die)</hi> and harkened vnto that lying ſpeech of the Serpent, <hi>Yee ſhall not die.</hi>

But now when Father <hi>Adam</hi> hath taſted of that forbidden fruite, O, how was he bewitched? He was once in the ſtate of grace, but now of diſgrace, hee was once the childe of God, but now in danger (for ought he knoweth) to be the ſlaue of the Serpent. God did once care altogether for him, but now hee muſt care and ſhift for himſelfe: hee was warme without apparell, naked without ſhame, ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out labour or paine, his meat was put into his mouth. But now it is come out of his noſtrels, and is loathſome vnto him. <note place="margin">Numb. 11.20.</note> And now hee muſt be pinched with cold, and ſcorched with heate, <note place="margin">Gen. 31.40.</note> he muſt trauell hard, and in the ſweat of his browes muſt eate his bread. <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> While hee kept himſelfe within his compaſſe hee was a happie man (for which he was to thank God) and now being in miſerie, hee is accurſed and vnhappie, for which hee may thanke himſelfe. A lamentable fall, a pitifull caſe, the wrath of God ouerrunneth the whole world, as a gangrene through all <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie, for his diſobedience: his treaſon hath attainted all his children, his whole bloud is corrupted, his fall redoundeth to all of vs that came of him. Alas, then how ſhall we doe? <hi>Adam</hi> is duſt, hated of God, and aſhamed of himſelfe, he is accurſed, hee is ſicke with ſinne, hee is dead,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1365:6"/> twice dead, ſubiect to mortalitie, and ſubiect to eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; his children bee in the ſame caſe. Woe therefore bee vnto vs, we are ſo benumbed with our ſinnes, that wee feele not the ſting of death fixed therein, the impoſtume of ſinne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hidden in our hearts, ſo pleaſingly to our carnall ſence, as that we thinke our ſelues whole and ſound, as if we preſumed we ſhould neuer die.

               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> the Father of all Nations was once a free-man, a bleſſed man, the childe of God; the mercie of God imbraced him on euery ſide. In the earth there were bleſſings for him ingrauen, as it were, in the herbes, flowers and fruits; yea in the heauens and in the waters, he ſaw innumerable tokens of Gods loue towards him: But alas, wretch that he was, when he was in honor he forgot himſelf, he denied God his ſeruice, yea he obeyed his Enemie; and therefore became accurſed, and debarred of all his former bleſſings. He became a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a curſed creature, the ſeruant of ſinne and Satan, aſhamed of his nakedneſſe, and trembled at Gods voice. So that death and the graue haue obtained the victorie; for <hi>Adam</hi> and his wife are become a curſed couple; yea, not onely they, but all their poſteritie; they be the roote, we be the branches. If the roote bee bitter, the branches muſt bee ſo alſo: they bee the Fountaine, we be ſprings; if the fountaine be filthie, ſo muſt the ſprings be. Sinne and corruption bee the riches that wee bequeath to our children; Rebellion is the inheritance that we haue purchaſed for them: Death is the wages that we haue procured vnto them; ſuch as the father is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch bee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

And therefore let vs rippe vp the whole condition and ſtate of mankinde; and then you ſhall perceiue the frailties and miſeries thereof, ſince the fall of our firſt Parents. And this principally conſiſteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of the holy man <hi>Iob,</hi> in the beginning of his fourteenth Chapter, <note place="margin">Iob 14.1.2:</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Man that is borne of a woman, is of ſhort continuance, and full of miſeries. Hee ſhooteth forth as a flower, and is cut downe, he vaniſheth alſo as a ſhadow, and continueth not.</hi> To the end we might want nothing in the deſcription of humane calamities, it ſeemeth his purpoſe and drift was to begin with the very matter it ſelfe, of the which man was made. For he is called <hi>Homo ab humo,</hi> becauſe he was made and created of the earth; neither was he made of the beſt of the earth, but of the ſlime (as the Scripture doth teſtifie) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt filthie and abiect part of the earth; amongſt all bodies the moſt vile element, amongſt all elements the earth is the baſeſt, amongſt all parts of the earth, none is more filthy and abiect then the ſlime.</p>
               <p>Wherefore man was made of that matter, then the which nothing is more vile and baſe. And whereas he ſaith that hee was borne of woman, he hath in few words comprehended many miſeries of humane condition. For firſt of all our verie faſhioning and breeding in the wombe, is ſo vnpure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, that it is not for chaſt eares to heare, but to be paſſed ouer in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, after that man is once conceiued, doth he not endure great calamities in his mothers wombe, as it were in a filthie and vncleane priſon, where euery moment he is in perill of his life? At the laſt he is borne naked, weake, ignorant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all helpe and counſell, not able to goe, to ſpeake, nor to helpe himſelfe; and all that he can doe, is to crie, and that is to ſet forth his miſeries. For he is borne to labour, a baniſhed man from his countrie, in poſſibilitie to liue a few daies and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1365:7"/> thoſe full of miſerie and perill, deuoid of all quietneſſe and reſt.</p>
               <p>Behold then the very beginning from whence man hath his firſt originall and breeding.</p>
               <p>In the next place the ſhort time comes to be conſidered, and for that <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith further, that <hi>man is of ſhort continuance,</hi> and herein you may behold ſome other calamities of mans bodie, the building being ſcarce finiſhed is readie to totter, and ſure ere long to fall. Man is ſcarce entred into the world, when as he was admoniſhed to remember his departure out of the ſame againe. <hi>Man</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>being borne of a woman, is of ſhort continuance, and full of miſeries.</hi> Euery word hath a great emphaſis, <hi>He is full of miſeries euen from the ſole of the foote to the crowne of the head, there is no ſoundneſſe in it,</hi>

                  <hi>but wounds and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores.</hi> Not only the body, but the mind alſo, ſo long as it is captiued in the priſon of the body; Thus no place is left emptie and free from miſeries. Mans miſeries are many and great, there is no member, no ſence, no one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in man, ſo long as he is heere vpon earth, which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not his hell; nay all the elements, all liuing creatures, all the Diuels, yea the Angels, and God himſelfe doe alſo bend and band themſelues againſt man for ſinne.</p>
               <p>To begin with the ſence of feeling: with how many kinds of Feauers, Impoſtumes, Vlcers, Sores, is the bodie afflicted?</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1365:8"/> the remedies themſelues, it were to be wiſhed, that there were one to be found, that were no more vehement to vexe the ſicke, then the diſeaſe it ſelfe. Long faſting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hunger is a bitter medicine, the inciſion of wounds and ſores, the cutting off of members, the ſearing of the fleſh and ſinewes, the pulling out of teeth, are remedies for diſeaſes and griefes, but yet ſuch, as many had rather chuſe to die then to vſe them.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, immoderate heat, exceeding cold, one while too much drought, another while too much moiſture, doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and hurt the very ſenſe of feeling. The ſenſe of taſting is moſt of al troubled with hunger and thirſt, and many times medicines and meates that are bitter, ſharpe, ſalt and vnſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doe diſtemper it. The ſence of ſmelling is compelled to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure many times all manner of ſtinckes and noyſome ſmells, ill vapours and fogges.

And ſo ſaith, it is an infirmitie and weakeneſſe indeed for the childe of God to haue any ſuch thoughts and paſſions.</p>
               <p>Moreouer and beſides all theſe things, there is yet an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall warre, which man hath within his owne bowels continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: For what man is he, which feeleth not the ſtriuings, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and contentions of his owne affection, will, ſenſe, and reaſon? In ſo much that man himſelfe doth afflict himſelfe, and vnderſtandeth it not. Yea he is a greater enemy to himſelfe, then any other can bee. For who doth greater harme to thee then thou doſt to thy ſelfe? Who more then thy ſelfe letteth thee, and turneth thee away from thy felicitie? Who then ſeeth not that man is ſet in the very Center of the Spheres, that miſeries may fall vpon him from euery part; and as the white in a butte, <note place="margin">Lam. 3.12.</note> that the arrowes and darts of all miſeries and kinds
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1365:10"/> of death may bee directed vnto him? Walkeſt thou in the ſtreets? the tiles aboue thy head threaten thy downefall: In the fields, the ayre is ready to conuey infection into thy lungs, the earth grones vnder thee, as loath to beare ſo vnprofitable a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. At laſt comes death with his napkin on his ſleeue, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.22.23.</note> and his trencher-knife in his hand, and with his voider takes all away.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee what followeth. <hi>Iob</hi> telleth thee, <hi>that man ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth as a flower, and is cut downe,</hi> whereby he teacheth that mans life is fraile and tranſitorie. A flower verily is a comely and a beautifull thing; and yet for all that it is nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing found more fading and vaniſhing. Euen ſo man, during the time of his fading and flouriſhing youth, ſeemeth to be of a wonderfull comelineſſe; but this beauty is of ſmall price, becauſe it is more britle then the graſſe, ſeeing that man carrieth alwayes the cauſe of his owne death in his vaines and bowels. For mans fading away is ſuch, and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den oftentimes, that there can be no reaſon giuen of his death; for many haue gone to bedde well in the euening that in the morning are found dead in their beds; and many that haue bin well at their vpriſing, haue beene dead before the euening; and many very ſodainly haue dropped downe in the ſtreetes and high-wayes, as they haue walked about their affaires: And this is no wonder, if we conſider well the ſubſtance of mans body, which being a building compact of ſl mie clay, is eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne with a ſmall thing.</p>
               <p>And how commeth it to paſſe (I pray you) that clockes are ſo eaſily ſtopped from their courſe? Is it not becauſe they are made with ſo many wheeles, that if one be ſtayed, all the reſt be letted. If this befall clockes that haue wheeles of Iron and ſteele, how much more eaſily may it come to paſſe in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane clocke of mans body, the wheeles and engines whereof are not of Iron, neither <hi>part of yron, and part of clay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 2.33.</note> like the feete of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, but all of clay. And <hi>behold as the clay is in the Potters hand, ſo are yee in mine hand,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 18.6.</note> 
                  <hi>O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> ſaith the Lord by his Prophet.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1365:11"/>
               <p>Therefore let vs not wonder at the frailtie of mans body, but at the fooliſhneſſe of mans minde, who vpon ſo fraile a foundation is wont to erect and build ſuch loftie towers.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is another miſery which is ſignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the compariſon of flower, as namely the deceitfulnes of mans life; the which indeed is the greateſt miſerie. For as fained vertue is double iniquitie, ſo counterfeit happineſſe is a two-fold miſerie and calamitie. If this preſent life would ſhew it ſelfe to be ſuch as it is indeed, the miſery thereof ſhould not greatly hurt vs; but as it is, it doth greatly damnifie vs, becauſe it is falſe and deceitfull, and being foule, it maketh a very faire and glorious ſhew; being euer mutable, it will ſeeme to bee ſtable and conſtant, being moſt ſhort, it beareth vs in hand that it is continuall; that ſo men (being deceiued) may beleeue that they ſhall haue time to fulfill all their luſts, and yet time and ſpace enough to repent. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> concludeth this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thus, <hi>He vaniſheth alſo as a ſhadow, and neuer continueth at one ſtay.</hi> To make this more plaine, behold and conſider the ſeuerall ages of man, and thou ſhalt euidently perceiue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable alterations of humane life. Childhood is weake, as well in minde as in body; flouriſhing youth is weake in mind, but ſtrong in bodie; ripe and manly age ſtrong both in mind and body, old age ſtrong in mind, and weak in body; crooked old doting age, is in this twice a childe, weake both in minde and bodie: therefore <hi>man flyeth as a ſhadow, and neuer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at one ſtay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, he is now wiſe, now fooliſh, now merry, now ſad, now in health, anon ſicke, now ſtrong, anon weake, now rich, anon poore, now he loueth anon he hateth, now he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, by and by hee feareth, one while hee laugheth, another while he weepeth, now he will, anon hee will not. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Moone, or any other thing that is changeable, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo many changes to vs, as doe the daily and moſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alterations of men. And yet for all this they liue as men in a frenzie, which know not their owne miſeries. Yet if it were poſſible, they would make the place of their exile and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1365:11"/> their countrie and inheritance. But in vaine they deſire this, for death commeth ere they are aware, ſhutting vp and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the life it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>So the miſeries incident to the ſeueral ages of man, are from the firſt comming vp vpon the ſtage of this world, to the laſt act of going downe, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.14.</note> in al parts of the life full of <hi>vanitie and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt entrance is our infancie, when wee are in our nurſes armes: and doth not that begin with teares and feares? And is not all that time vnhappie? ſauing that we want reaſon, that is, the vſe thereof to apprehend that happineſſe. When we come out of our nurſes armes, to goe in their hands, or to goe by our ſelues, in our next age doe we not weepe long vnder the rod, falling into the ſubiection of a teacher? Amongſt the ancient Romanes this was their manner and cuſtome for their youth, They let their children ſuck vntill they were two yeers old, till they were foure yeeres old, they let them play, till ſixe they taught them to reade, till eight to write, till ten they learne the Grammer. When a boy was once ten yeeres old, he was ſet ſtraight way to ſome good trade and occupation, or elſe ſent to the warres, which was a thing the Romanes gloried in moſt, to bee good ſouldiers. In all which ages they ſuſtained great miſeries, being all this time vnder Tutors and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>When we come out of the priſon of boyes and girles, and are ſet at ſome more libertie in a yong mans life, are wee not toſſed, as vpon a ſea of vnquietneſſe, ſailing betweene reaſon and paſſion, as between two contrary waters and croſſe winds. Then commeth perfect age or mans age, and what haue wee heere but blaſtes and ſtormes of greater vnreſt then in any age before? From one trauaile we paſſe to another, neuer ending but changing our miſeries. And when we come to old age, and haue liued ſo long that we are come to dotage: is there any thing in theſe ages exempt from miſerie and trauaile, that is vnder the Sunne?</p>
               <p>Surely our infirmities do then come vpon vs in multitudes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1365:12"/> yea ſo loade vs with their waight and number, that they make vs to bowe and goe double vnder them vnto the earth. And can there be any comfort in theſe diſeaſes (as I may call them) and dayes of euill, wherein doe meete and flocke together ſo many vultures of life, the weakeneſſe of infancie, the ſeruitude of childehood, the ſickneſſe of youth, the cares of mans age? All which come againe, and come all together, as many ſtormes, vpon one poore old ruinous houſe, that is ſore ſhaken alreadie, by death violently to ouerthrow it for euer. Heere the exceſſe and ryot of youth is exerciſed with gouts, palſies, and ſundrie fearefull aches; the watching and cares of manhood are puniſhed with loſſe of ſight, of hearing, and of ſence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ſence of paine.</p>
               <p>There is no part of man, which death in that age of yeares, doth not take, in hope to be aſſured of him, as of a bad pay-maſter which greatly feareth, and would gladly put off his dayes of payment. And therefore it bringeth him low in all parts, that he may haue power in none to auoid his Creditor, and end ſo neere.</p>
               <p>And touching the miſeries incident to the ſeuerall ages of man, the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> crieth out, <hi>How is it that I came out of the wombe to ſee labour and ſorrow,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 20.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that my dayes ſhould be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſhame?</hi> How much more cauſe haue we miſerable creatures, to crie out of our calamities and miſeries, who were conceiued and borne in ſinne, ſeeing the Prophet complained ſo much, <note place="margin">51.5. Ier. 1.5.</note> being ſanctified in his mothers wombe.</p>
               <p>O vaine, miſerable, and vnhappie men, before we ſinne, we are ſtraite faſtened to ſinne, and before we can offend, wee are faſt bound with offence.</p>
               <p>Conſider, O man, from whence thou cameſt, bluſh whither thou goeſt, and feare where thou liueſt. We are begotten in vncleanneſſe, brought foorth with paines and throwes, and nouriſhed in darkneſſe. Wee begin our tragedie with naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and weeping, we continue with paine and vexation, and take our farewell with ſorrow and miſerie. Our beginning is lamentable, our continuance wretched, and our departure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1365:12"/> grieuous. The whole life of man is beſet and incountred with three capitall enemies, Paine, Care, and Sorrow: Paine pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, Care conſumeth vs, and Sorrow endeth vs. There is no age of man free from affliction, calamitie and miſerie. And to begin againe with the miſeries of infancie; behold in his birth, intollerable is his mothers paine, and infinite are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants calamities, who commeth into the world crying and weeping, poore and naked, weake and miſerable, without ſpeech, without knowledge or ſtrength, no ſooner is the babe borne, but ſtraight is hee bound hand and foote, and caſt into a cradle, as into a priſon, prefiguring the ſeruitude hee is to ſuffer.</p>
               <p>In his childhood he beginneth to warre with the lacke of reaſon, and to fight againſt his owne folly, not knowing what hee is, where hee is, whence nor for what hee came into the world.</p>
               <p>Now muſt he be kept vnder the feare of the rod, and learne ſome Liberall Science, or ſome Mechanicall Arte or Trade, whereby to maintaine his fraile life hereafter, if hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it.</p>
               <p>Then commeth youth, raſh, head-ſtrong, voluptuous, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, fooliſh, prodigall, paſſionate. In this age he commeth into great dangers, fighting againſt the deſires of the fleſh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fond affections, and vaine imaginations, which cauſe the minde to wauer, and bee inconſtant, and to bee carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ſundrie phantaſies. In this age hee becommeth a drunkard, a gameſter, a quarreller, a looſe liuer, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be caſt into priſon, to bee hanged, and to loſe all that hee hath, and to be a great griefe vnto his parents, <note place="margin">Gen. 42.38.</note> in cauſing them thereby to end their dayes in ſorrow; in the ſence and feeling whereof, the Prophet crieth vnto God, ſaying, <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not the ſinnes of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterward, as he hath to encounter with manhood, to which age is incident, the charge of wife &amp; children, the maintenance of family and care of poſterity. <hi>He that is maried</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>careth for the things that are of the world,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.33.</note> 
                  <hi>how he may pleaſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1365:13"/> his wife.</hi> Sometimes he is beſieged with a deſire and carking care and couetouſneſſe, ſomtime with feare to loſe his goods, and other infinite ſuch vanities and afflictions.</p>
               <p>Then laſtly commeth old age ſtealing on vnperceiued, <hi>yea gray haires</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are heere and there vpon him,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 7.9. Ioel 1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>yet hee knoweth it not.</hi> In this age man receiues many incurable wounds, as baldneſſe, bleared eyes, deafe cares, wrinckled browes, ſtinking breath, trembling hands, faint ſpirits, leane cheekes, corruption of ſtomacke, with like miſeries innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which neuer leaue to wound the bodie, diſquiet the minde, and torment the conſcience. And thus are wee toſſed all the dayes of our life with griefe, compaſſed with cares, and ouerwhelmed with miſeries and calamities. And therefore <hi>Plato</hi> well obſerued that a man is <hi>Arbor inuerſa,</hi> a tree turned vpward, his haire of his head the root, the armes the branches, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
               <p>So that our infancie is but a dreame, our childhood but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our youth madnes, our manhood a combate, our age a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, our life miſery, and our death ſorrow. How weake is infancie, how ignorant is childhood, how light &amp; inconſtant adoleſcencie, how intractable and confident bee yong men, how grieuous and irkeſome is old age? What is a yong boy but as a brute beaſt, hauing the forme only and ſhape of a man? What is a flouriſhing yonker, but as an vntamed horſe, what is an old man, but a receptacle of all maladies and diſeaſes? And this age is a degree neerer to death, by common courſe, then the former ages; for theſe yeeres take all pleaſures from our life, wherin affliction followeth affliction, as <hi>the clouds returne after the raine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.2. 2. Sam. 19,34,35.</note> and in theſe ſtooping yeeres euery ſteppe is in death, and they may ſay with <hi>Barzilla, How long haue I to liue?</hi> when their houſes are turned into their priſons, and they haue no taſte in that they eate or drinke. And they hauing thus the markes of age in their face, and vpon their heads, yet (as they that would ſtil be yong) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider not that they draw neere to their graue, &amp; haue toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a blaſted life, in which age they can neither put off nor put on their owne clothes.</p>

               <p>Yong men (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) haue death behind them, old men haue death before them, and all men haue death not farre from them. Experience plainly teacheth, and all ages approue, that God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Death moſt commonly hath three harbengers, that make way againſt he come, <hi>viz.</hi> Caſualtie, Sickneſſe, and Old-age. Caſualtie telleth me death is at my backe, Sickneſſe telleth me ſhee is at my heeles, and Old-age telleth me ſhee is before my face. Sickneſſe is reckoned by <hi>Hugo</hi> amongſt the meſſengers of death, of which there are three, <hi>Caſus, Infirmitas, Senectus, Caſus nunciat mortem latentem, Infirmitas apparentem, Senectus praeſentem.</hi> Caſualties ſhew vs death lurking for vs, Sickneſſe, appearing vnto vs, Old-age ſaith death is preſent and ready to fetch vs.</p>
               <p>The aged man holdeth his life as an Eele by the taile, which he would faine hold faſt, but cannot, becauſe it is ſo ſlipperie and ſlideth from him.</p>
               <p>Many times death taketh for a gage one part or other of our body, as an arme, or eye, or legge, or hand, finger or tooth, or ſome of our ſences, or ſuch like, for an aduertiſement, that hee will very ſhortly fetch away the reſt. If any man be long a dying and paying Deaths debt, Nature (like a rigorous credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that will be paid at the iuſt day) ſueth out an execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her debtor, taking from one his ſight, from another his hearing, and both from ſome, and he that tarieth longeſt in the world, ſhee foundereth, maineth, and vtterly diſableth in his limbes. So that as man, in reſpect of himſelfe, is vaine and miſerable, ſo alſo is hee much more in regard of the qualitie and condition of his life and calling. For there is no kinde of life (meaning wherby life is maintained) but it is mingled with frailetie and many grieuances. If thou liue abroad (to wit, in Offices) there are ſtrifes, if at home, there are cares, in the field, labours, in the ſea, feare, in iourneying, if it be void of ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardie, yet it is painefull and tedious. If thou art maried, then canſt thou not be without cares, if not maried, then is thy life
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1365:14"/> weariſome: Haſt thou children? then ſhalt thou haue ſorrow. Haſt thou none? then is thy life vnpleaſant. Thy youth is wilde and fooliſh, thy age weake and fraile, and infinit are the dangers that depend thereon. For one bewaileth his loſſes, another weepeth for lacke of health, liberty and neceſſarie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. The workman maymeth himſelfe with his owne toole, while he earneſtly plyeth his buſineſſe; the idle perſon is pined with famine; the gambler breaketh his limbes with gaming; the adulterer conſumeth himſelfe with botches and leproſie; the dicer ſuddenly ſtabbed with a dagger; and the Student con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually wrung with the gout, beſides infinite more miſeries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to mans life, too long heere to rehearſe. For there is no calling, ſtate or degree exempt or free from vanitie, miſerie, and death. All are vaine, all are vexed, all are tormented with worldly tempeſts, all doe ſuffer the dolefull blaſts of miſerie and calamitie.</p>
               <p>To begin with the ſtrongeſt Champion, the mightieſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, the greateſt Emperour or Prince that euer liued on the earth, and to come downe to the pooreſt wretch and meaneſt miſer in the world, you ſhall find that all of all ſorts, poore and rich, maſter and ſeruant, maried and vnmaried, ſubiect and Prince: to conclude, the bad and the good are tormented with temptations, toſſed with tempeſts, diſquieted with aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and therefore are moſt fraile, moſt miſerable, yea and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſerie.</p>

               <p>We reade that the great <hi>Soladine</hi> of Babylon, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of all, confeſſed (though too late (that dying in the Citie of Aſcalon, hee commanded that his ſhirt ſhould bee carried about the Citie on a ſpeare, with this proclamation, <hi>Behold, the great King of all the Eaſt is dead,</hi> and of all his great riches, this is all hee carrieth with him away. Which if this wretched man had well conſidered, hee would not haue beene ſuch an inſatiable <hi>Hellno</hi> of kingdoms. For what is gold or ſiluer? nothing elſe but concocted earth, ſubiect to inconſtancie, gotten with paine, labour, and toyle, kept with great care, and loſt, not without intollerable ſorrow; which by fire, theeues ſhipwrack, war and ſuch like meanes, may be taken away.

What is this world but an Inne, a common Citie, a Campe? What is our life but a peregrination, a warfare? What is man but a gueſt, a traueller, a ſouldier vpon earth? and Death is the Porter, he ſtandeth at the gate, and ſtayeth all the riches which we haue gotten and ſcraped together, he willeth and conſtraineth vs to leaue all behind, and ſendeth vs out as we came into the world, naked, poore, and beggerly, onely with our winding-ſheete about vs, at the moſt. Next let vs deſcend to the condition of a Seruant or a bond-man: Is he not loaden with labour, wearied with watchings, and worne out with ſlauery, he is beaten with ſtripes, ſpoyled of his ſubſtance, and burdened with ſorrow: the maſters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is the ſeruants paine, and the ſeruants fault is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters prey. If he haue wealth, he muſt ſpend it at his maſters pleaſure, if hee haue nought, then muſt his paines make a painefull purchaſe. Then commeth the maſter in his turne, who euer liueth in feare leſt his ſeruants treacherie ſhould ſhorten his daies. If he be gentle, then is he contemned, if ſeuere, hated; for courteſie bringeth contempt, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie breedeth hatred. And vngodly and vnthriftie ſeruants are alſo the miſeries of their maſters.</p>
               <p>Alſo the vnmarried man fighteth againſt fond deſires, and fleſhly luſts; for that vnquiet Iebuſite will hardly bee reſtrained. <hi>All men cannot receiue the gifts of continencie,</hi>

               <p>Now this married man is at his wits end, burning with iealouſie: <note place="margin">Num. 5.14.</note> feare of loſing his goods doth vexe him, loſſe of riches maketh him tremble, and the charge of houſhold doth diuide him diuerſly.

               <p>Finally, the King himſelfe liueth in feare of the treachery of traytors; he is ſet vpon a hill, as it were a marke: A ſmall wart deformeth a Princes face, and in a King an error is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate.

Whereupon an Heathen Hiſtoriographer maketh mention of a King, to whom the Crowne and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were offered: who, before he wore it, tooke the Crowne in his hand, and beholding it a while, cryed out, ſaying, <hi>O thou golden Diademe, if man knew the miſeries and griefes thou bringeſt with thee, there is none would ſtoope ſo low as to take thee vp from the ground.</hi> Shewing thereby, that the life of Kings is more vnhappie, then the life of a priuate man. He is ſubiect to claw-backes and flatterers: It comming to paſſe oftentimes (ſaith an ancient Father) that Courtiers are found flatterers, and hee is ſeldome without mendicant and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Fryers about him, <note place="margin">Prou. 30.15.</note> which are like the Horſeleaches two daughters alwayes crying, <hi>Giue, giue.</hi>

               <p>As it is true that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks, Gods ordinance is not the midwife of iniquity ſo is it moſt certaine that men in authoritie, by reaſon of fleſh and bloud, doe trauell in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, and bring forth eſcapes.

Vpon a time, when the <hi>Bithynians,</hi> before <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, cried againſt one <hi>Iunius Clio</hi> (their late Preſident) deſiring, that now his time was come, hee of all men might no more obtaine that place. The Emperour not vnderſtanding their deſire, nor hearing diſtinctly their words for the confuſed noiſe of the multitude, demanded of thoſe next him what the people ſaid, to whom <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> a familier, or rather an auricular buzze of the Emperours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered like a falſe Eccho, that the people gaue his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie great thankes for their laſt Preſident (which was nothing ſo) and requeſted to haue him appointed ouer them againe, which was wholly contrary to their ſuite: The Emperour meaning well, but ill informed (to gratifie them, as hee thought) aſſigned them their olde Preſident againe. And thus was the Emperour abuſed, and the people continued vnder an Oppreſſor ſtill, whereas they had beene eaſed, but for a crooked Interpreter. And this aduertiſeth what cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect care the greateſt men ſhould haue to paſſe no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great importance raſhly, as alſo to cleanſe their trains

               <p>The Rich man in the Goſpell gathered much, poſſeſſed much, enlarged his garners, and promiſed to himſelfe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">Luk. 12.19.20.</note> with a retired farewell to the world. <hi>Soule</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>thou haſt much goods laid vp for many yeeres, take thine eaſe, eate, drinke and be merrie.</hi> But God ſaid vnto him, <hi>Thou foole, this night ſhall thy ſoule be taken from thee, then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt prouided?</hi> Alas, this was (it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) the firſt night of his reſt, and muſt it be the laſt too?

                  <hi>Eſay</hi> anſwereth them, <hi>There is no reſt to the vngodly.</hi> He that hath a long iourney to goe in a ſhort time, maketh haſt, and he who remembreth euery day, runneth away with his life, cannot ſit ſtill. But where men promiſe to themſelues long life, and much time, there they waxe wanton, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſecure, and put farre away the euill day (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh). <note place="margin">Amos 6.3.</note> Therefore the Lord doth commend our life vnto vs in all theſe Scriptures which we haue heard, and in other places in a ſhort abſtract of dayes, and not in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of yeeres.

Which was to teach her, and vs in her to thinke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day to be our laſt day, and therefore to do that this day, as in our tine, which we are not ſure to doe the next day, as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1365:20"/> in the time that God hath taken to himſelfe, and from vs, as being more properly his, then our day.</p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>boaſt not thy ſelfe</hi> (ſaith the Wiſeman) <hi>of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 27.1.</note> And there is one more this day of thy number ſpent, and thou art now nearer to thy end by a day. But if any man doth think that he may liue as yet many yeeres, his yeares may lacke moneths, his moneths may lacke weekes, his weekes may lacke daies, his daies may lacke houres, nay his houres may lacke minutes; an houre is but a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>But while one houre by continuall ſucceſſion is added to another, the whole courſe of our life is finiſhed, euery houre runneth away with ſome part of our life: and euen then, when our bodies grow and increaſe, our liues fade and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, yea euen this day (wherein we liue) wee diuide and part with death. There is none (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) but is nearer death at the yeares end, then at the beginning, to morrow, then to day, to day, then yeſterday, by and by, then iuſt now, and now, then a little before. Each part of time that we paſſe (if time haue parts) cuts off ſo much from our life, and the remainder ſtill decreaſeth When childhood commeth on, infancie dieth; when adoleſcencie commeth, childhood dieth; when youth commeth, adoleſcencie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; when old age commeth, youth dieth; when death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, all and euery age dyeth. So that looke how many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ages we deſire to liue, ſo many degrees of death we deſire to die. Aske an old man where is his infancie, where his childhood, where his adoleſcencie, where his youth, ſhall he not ſay true, if he anſwere, alas, all theſe are dead and gone. What ſpeake I of ages? Euery yeare, moneth, day, houre of our life that we haue liued, is dead to vs, and wee are dead with them. What therefore is our whole life, but a long death? What is euery day therof, but (as <hi>Petrach</hi> ſaith) a degree of death, what is euery moment thereof, but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto death?</p>
               <p>Againe, that the daies of man are but few, and his life
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1365:21"/> very ſhort, experience, and that which we ſee in daily vſe, doth ſhew, beſides the word of God, which, for this, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of mans ſhort time, vſeth to take the ſhorteſt diuiſion in nature to expreſſe it.

                  <hi>For a thouſand yeeres in thy ſight are but as yeſterday, when it is paſt:</hi> a life which is gone as ſoone as it comes, a life of few houres, <hi>as a watch in the night;</hi> the life of a thought, wherof there may be a thouſand in an houre: a life of nothing; this Prophet meaſureth it with a ſhort ſpan. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.15.</note>

               <p>This preſent tranſitorie life is called a pilgrimage, <note place="margin">Gen. 47.9.</note> a path, a trauell, and a way, becauſe it continually plieth to an end: for as they which are carried in coaches, <note place="margin">Eccle. 40 1.</note> or ſaile in ſhippes finiſh their voyage, <note place="margin">Pſal. 1.1.</note> though they ſit ſtill and ſleepe, euen ſo euery one of vs, albeit we be buſied about other matters, and perceiue not how the courſe of our life paſſeth away, being ſometime at reſt, ſometime idle, and ſometime in ſport and daliance, yet our life alwaies waſteth, and wee in poſting ſpeed, haſten toward our end. The way faring man trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth apace, and leaueth many things behinde him in his way. He ſeeth ſtately towers and buildings, he beholdeth and admireth them a while, and ſo paſſeth from them; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he ſeeth goodly fields, meadowes, flouriſhing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and pleaſant vineyards, vpon theſe alſo he looketh a while, he wondereth at the ſight, and ſo paſſeth by, then hee meeteth with fruitfull orchards, greene forreſts, ſweete ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers with ſiluer ſtreames, and behaueth himſelfe as before.

               <p>Furthermore, in high waies and foot-pathes this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we ſee, that where one hath ſet his foote, there ſoone after another taketh his ſteppe, a third defaceth the print of his predeceſſors foote, and then another doth the like. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any, who for any long time holdeth or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his place. And is not mans life ſuch?</p>
               <p>Aske (ſaith <hi>Baſil</hi>) the fields and poſſeſſions, how many names they haue now changed. In former ages they were ſaid to be ſuch a mans, then his, afterwards anothers, now they are ſaid to bee this mans, and in ſhort time to come, they ſhall be called, I cannot tell whoſe poſſeſſions; and why ſo? Becauſe mans life is a certaine way, wherein one ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and expelleth another.</p>
               <p>Behold the ſeates of States and Potentates, of Emperors and Kings, how many in euery age haue aſpired vnto theſe dignities and degrees; and when they haue attained them, after much trauell, labour and waiting, in ſhort time they are compelled to giue way to their ſucceſſors, before they haue well warmed their ſeats.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday one raigned, to day he is dead, &amp; another poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth his roome and throne; to morrow this man ſhall die, and another ſhall ſit in his ſeat.

For the time which we haue liued is now no more in the eſſence of our life, for now our infancy and childhood liueth not, and that wherein we liue, which is but the preſent time, is ſo ſhort &amp; fleeting that it cannot be circumſcribed, <hi>Inſtans eſt, momentum eſt, ictus oculi eſt.</hi> It is an inſtant, a moment, the twinckling of an eye.

               <p>The reaſons why our life is become ſo fraile and ſhort are principally theſe; firſt, iniquitie now aboundeth, and more in theſe latter times, then in former ages. And <hi>becauſe iniquitie ſhall abound</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt) <note place="margin">Mat. 24.12.</note>

               <p>Thirdly our life is as nothing, that Gods children might ſoone be deliuered from their burdens, and from thoſe that oppreſſe them in this life, and that the wicked, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

For if mans life might now extend to the yeeres which were before the Floud, when men liued (as we haue heard) ſix, ſeuen, eight, nine hundred, and almoſt a thouſand yeares; this cruel age in which we liue, would too long torment, and too vilely deale with Gods faithfull ones, there being no hooke of ſhort time in the iawes of the wicked, to keepe them in feare, as now, when death is ſuch a tyrant, and ſhort life ſuch a curbe vnto them, that they dare not, or cannot doe as they would. And indeed how can they doe that in their fortie, and vnder foureſcore, which they might and would bee bold to doe, being men of might in their hundreds.

               </p>
               <p>There is no priuiledge that can preſerue a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death; Art thou ſtrong? and doth the conceit of thy ſtrength lift thee vp in pride?

               <p>Is it for thy bewtie? Theſe eyes of thine, which now are as bright as ſtarres. Death will make a horror to the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Theſe cheekes of thine, wherein now the lilly and the

                  <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that in ſtead of ſweete ſmell, there ſhall be a ſtinke, and in ſtead of a girdle, a rent, and in ſtead of well ſet haire, baldneſſe, and in ſtead of a ſtomacher, a girding of ſack-cloath, and burning in ſtead of beautie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of bodily beauty conſiſteth in naught elſe but in phlegme, bloud, moiſture, and gall or melancholie, which are maintained by the corruptible iuyces of meates; hereby the apples of the eyes gliſter, the cheekes are ruddie, and the whole face is adorned: And vnleſſe they be daily moiſtened with ſuch iuyce, which aſcendeth out of the liuer, incontinent the skinne is dried vp, the eyes waxe hollow, all ruddineſſe and bewtie depart from the viſage.</p>
               <p>Now if thou conſider what is hidden vnder that skinne which thou iudgeſt ſo beautifull, what is ſhut vp within the noſtrils, what in the iawes and belly, thou wilt proteſt that this brauery of body is nothing but a painted ſepulchre, which without appeareth faire to men, <note place="margin">Math. 23.27.</note> but within is full of filthineſſe and vncleanneſſe. And if thou ſee in a ragged cloath the phlegme and ſpitle that proceedeth from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, thou loatheſt it, and wilt not touch it with the typ of thy finger, looking askew thereon. Therefore this cell and ſeat of phlegme, this bewtiful body will be ſo much altered, that a man may ſay, O how much is he or ſhe changed from that they were.

               <p>But to digreſſe a little, doſt thou make thy ſelfe beautiful, and art not contented with that beautie, which God thy Creator hath beſtowed vpon thee?

               <p>Further doth not God call from his worke, ſome in the morning, ſome at noone, and ſome at night?

Yet more die yong then old, and more before ten, then after threeſcore. Beſides all this, the freſh life which the yongeſt haue heere, is cut off, or continued by the ſame decree and finger of God, that the oldeſt and moſt blaſted life is prolonged or finiſhed.

If wee bee old, wee may be ſure our turne is neere, and if we be yong, it may be as neere, for they that are old may trauell long, but they that are yong may haue a ſhorter way home. For the ſhort liuer runneth his race no faſter then hee that liueth long; both runne alike, both make ſpeed alike, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, the firſt hath not ſo farre to runne as the latter.

When we heare a ſolemne knell, we ſay ſome body is departed, <note place="margin">Acts 5.9.</note> and why ſhould not we thinke that the feete of them who cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out that bodie, is at the doore readie to carry vs out alſo?</p>

               <p>He was not an old man, and had much peace in his daies, to whom it was ſaid, <note place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note> 
                  <hi>O foole this night they will fetch away thy ſoule;</hi> ſo death worketh in vs, whether we will or not. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the ſtrong conſtitution in a yong man perſwadeth him that hee ſhall liue long; but no conſtitution in a man can enlarge his charter of life one poore houre. Indeed the good complexion of a man may be a ſigne of long life, <note place="margin">Exod. 20.12.</note> but he that prolongeth our dayes on earth, he only can make vs to liue long.</p>
               <p>Againe, the ſtrength and beautie of youth maketh him beleeue that he hath many yeeres yet to liue. Therefore the Wiſeman ſaith, <note place="margin">Prou. 20.29.</note> that <hi>the glory of yong men is their ſtrength,</hi> but how ſoone is this blighted &amp; ſtrucken, as the faire flower of graſſe with an Eaſt-winde. For beautie and ſtrength is but a flower, which if ſome ſickneſſe ſtrike not ſuddenly yet the <hi>Autumne</hi> of ripe yeares impaireth, and the winter of olde age killeth. And what careth death (which is indifferent to all) for a faire ſtrong and goodly complexion? Is not a beautifull face as mortall as a foule hue? The like may be ſpoken of health and ſtature of bodie: for what are they? and of what time? In their owne nature they are fickle things, and without good vſe, croſſes.</p>
               <p>For touching health, the devouring vulture of ſickneſſe doth after ſome ſhort time waſt it to nothing. Strength is common to vs with beaſts; and there are many beaſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede vs in ſtrength.</p>
               <p>And for our comely ſtature, it may as ſoone be brought downe to death, and as deepely bee buried in the coffin of the earth, as one of a meaner ſize. And further, if men haue not vſed theſe to Gods glory, but to pride and vaine-glorie, nor haue made them helpes to godlineſſe, but haue giuen them their head to ſinne; it will be ſaid after death of ſuch that a beautifull perſon, a ſtrong yong man, a goodly tall fellow, and one that neuer knew what ſickneſſe meant, is gone to hell.</p>
               <p>Therefore of beauty and her attendants, as ſtrength, health,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1365:28"/> and a goodly ſtature, that may be ſpoken, which vſually is ſpoken of fire and water, that they are good ſeruants, but ill Maſters; where they are ruled they doe good ſeruice, but where they ouer-rule, they make foule worke.</p>
               <p>Or is it for the greatnes? But that cannot priuiledge thee from death; for <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in wiſdome excelled all other men, who in riches exceeded euery man, who in power as mighty as any man, and who in birth was ſurpaſſed by no man, who for his wiſdome was admired of all, for his riches beloued of all, and for his power feared of all, and honored of all for his birth; euen he (I ſay) could not refraine to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe for all his wiſdome which was angelicall, for all his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which were innumerable, for all his power ſo maieſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and for all his birth, ſo regall, <note place="margin">Wiſ. 7.1 2.3.4 5.6.</note> He I ſay could not chuſe but cry out and ſay. <hi>I my ſelfe am a mortall man like to all and the ofſpring of him that was firſt made of the earth, and in my mothers wombe was faſhioned to be fleſh in the time of ten months being compacted in blood of the ſeede of man, and the pleaſure that came with ſleepe.

               <p>Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith. How far will ye great men ſtretch your couetiſe? Will ye dwell alone vpon the earth, and haue no poore man with you? Why put you out your fellow by kinde, and challenge to your ſelfe the poſſeſſion common by kinde; in common to all, for high and lowe, rich and poore, the earth was made. Why will ye rich change proper right herein? Kinde knoweth not riches, that bringeth forth all men poore, for we be not got with rich cloathes, and borne with gold, ne with ſiluer: naked he bringeth them into the world, needy of meat, and drinke, and cloathing, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the earth taketh vs, as ſhe naked brought vs hither. She cannot cloſe with vs our poſſeſſion in ſepulcher, for kinde maketh no difference, betweene poore and rich in comming hither, ne in going hence. All in one manner he bringeth forth, and in one manner he cloſeth in graue.</p>
               <p>Who ſo will make difference between poore and rich, abide till they haue a little while lyen in graue, then open &amp; looke among dead bones, <note place="margin">Lam. 4.5.</note> who was rich, and who was poore, but if it be thus that more cloathes rot with the rich then with the poore, and that doth harme to them that are then liuing, not profiting them that be dead. And it may be that the wormes ſhall feede more ſweetely on the rich, <note place="margin">Iob. 24.20.</note> then on the poore. But thou wilt ſay (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi>) I am not ſuch a one as he is, God forbid I ſhould be ſo, he is baſe and beggerly, I am high, honorable and rich; tell me not (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi>) The ods of your apparell, or other externall things, but marke ye the qualitie of nature, remember the day of your birth, and the day of your death. There is no difference in the one or the other, both weake, both miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for all of all ſorts and conditions are made of one mold, and one matter, of clay and earth, whoſe foundation is in the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1365:29"/> duſt, which ſhalbe deſtroyed before the moth. It is true that as there is difference of ſtarres, though all made of the ſame matter, and difference of mettals, ſome gold, <note place="margin">Iob. 4.19.</note> ſome ſiluer, ſome lead, ſome tinne, but all made of one earth; and differences of veſſels, ſome gold, ſome ſiluer, <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.20.</note> ſome wood, ſome earth and ſome to honor, and ſome to diſhonor, but all made of the ſame mould, ſo are there differences of bodies, ſome more excllent then other, and made of purer earth; but yet all ſubiect to corruption, as the matter is whereof they are made. It being the body, then that dyeth, and ſeeth corruption, one muſt dye as well as an other. For as great men haue no priuiledge from error, nor protection from reproofe, for their faults blameable, ſo haue they no priuiledge from Death. For all men haue one entrance into the world, a like danger in life, the ſame neceſſity of death, reſpect cannot change nature, nor circumſtance alter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: a great man is a man, a man hath a body and a ſoule, both haue their diſeaſes, which greatneſſe can neuer dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, but oftentimes augments. And therefore in a bodily infirmitie of ſome noble perſonages, the Phiſition takes them in hand, not as noble men, but as men. Phyſick they muſt haue, although with better attendance, more exquiſite and coſtly medicines, and skilfuller Doctors then the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort haue. Therefore doe they thinke becauſe they liue better and are in better eſtate, and haue better meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue life then poore men, that therefore they ſhall liue longer; and what difference concerning death betweene a noble man and a begger, when both goe to one place. <hi>All goe to one place,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, <hi>all are of duſt,</hi>

And the breath in the noſtrels of the rich man may as ſoone be ſtopped, and they as ſoone turne to the duſt as other men.

Thou cameſt lately into the world, and haſt found much, that was thy good hap; he came lately into the world, and found little, and yet his hap was not ill; nay it may be, better then thine. And what were it to haue a purple Coate, and a polluted conſcience, a gay gowne and a ſicke heart, a bed of gold and a diſeaſed minde, a full cheſt and an empty ſoule, a faire face and foule affections, to gliſter in iewels, and to be filthy in manners, to be in grace with men, and in diſgrace with God. <note place="margin">Luk. 16.15.</note> He that hath much worlds wealth and dignity, and but a ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace is inferiour to him that hath a great meaſure of grace, and but little, or no worlds wealth.

               <p>There is nothing that can free any one from Death, no, not length of daies, nor wiſdome, ſtrength, riches, beautie, nor talneſſe of ſtature.

               <p>Then if Monarches be ſo momentary, why ſhould mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls bee ſo proud? It is true that one writeth wittily of the Grammarian, of euery ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> that being able to decline all other nownes in euery caſe, hee could decline Death in no caſe.

It is in mans power, indeed, to ſay vnto Death, as ſometime King <hi>Canutus</hi> ſaid vnto the Sea, when it began to flow. <hi>Sea I command thee that thou touch not my feete:</hi> but his command was bootleſſe, for hee had no ſooner ſpoken the word, but the ſurging waues daſhed him: ſo may many ſay vnto Death, when it approacheth, I command thee not to come neere mee, but Death wil ſtrike him notwithſtanding. And no more power hath man to keepe backe Death, that it ſtrike not, then the mightieſt King on earth to keepe backe the Sea, that it flow not. The Sea will haue his fluxe, and Death will haue his courſe, they both keepe their old wont.

Nay Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe the Sonne of God, the onely Sonne, the Sonne in whom he was well pleaſed, more faithfull then <hi>Abraham,</hi> more righteous then <hi>Iob,</hi> more wiſe then <hi>Salomon,</hi> more mightie then <hi>Samſon,</hi> more holy then <hi>Dauid</hi> and all the Prophets, though hee knew no ſinne in himſelfe, yet for taking on him the burthen of our ſinnes, became ſubiect to the ſame condition of mortalitie with vs, and he died alſo.</p>
               <p>Examples of other times, experience of our owne teach vs that all of all ſorts die, and are gathered to their fathers, yea the dumbe and dead bodies cry this aloud vnto vs. As <hi>Baſil</hi> of <hi>Seleucia</hi> ſaith of <hi>Noah,</hi> he preached without words of Preaching; for euery ſtroake vpon the Arke was a reall Sermon of repentance, ſo euery corpſe that wee follow and accompany to the graue, preacheth really this truth vnto vs. All the worthieſt of the firſt times and whomſoeuer elſe the word of God hath well reported of, where are they? Are they not all dead? Doe they not all ſee corruption? (our Sauiour Chriſt excepted). Are they not all gone downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſlimie valley? Haue they not long ſince made their bed in the darke? None of them all (our Sauiour Chriſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1365:33"/> excepted) was able to deliuer his life from the power of the graue. Art thou better then <hi>Dauid,</hi> and wiſer then <hi>Salomon?</hi> Nay, art thou greater then our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is dead, and the Prophets which are dead? Whom makeſt thou thy ſelfe? If thou thinkeſt thou ſhouldeſt not die; Then ſurely if the holieſt begotten and borne of man doe die, then all muſt die. And if holineſſe muſt yeeld, then prophaneneſſe cannot ſtand out. And therfore whether holy or prophane, Iew or Greeke, bond or free, male or female, all muſt die. If the tender harted woman that wept for Chriſt, then the ſtony hearted men that ſcoffed at Chriſt. If thoſe that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed him, then thoſe that buffeted him. If ſhee that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red oyntment on his head, then he that ſpat in his face. If <hi>Iohn</hi> his beloued Apoſtle, then <hi>Iudas</hi> that betrayed him.</p>
               <p>Man is a little world, the world a great man, if the great man muſt die, how ſhall the little one eſcape? We muſt not thinke much to vndergoe that, which all are enioyned vnto neceſſarily. Equalitie is the chiefe ground-worke of equitie, and who can complaine to be comprehended, where all are contained. For there is not a ſonne of man in the cluſter of mankinde, but <hi>Eodem modo &amp; nodo, vinctus &amp; victus,</hi> is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that common and equal law of Death. And although they die not one death for time and manner, yet for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and end, one death is infallible to all the ſonnes of men. <hi>Lift vp your eyes to the heauens</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>and looke vpon the earth beneath,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 51.6.</note> 
                  <hi>for the heauens ſhal vaniſh away like ſmoake, and the earth ſhall waxe old like a garment, and they that dwell therein ſhall die in like manner.</hi> But if any ſhall obiect that <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> died not. <note place="margin">Gen. 23.24. Hebr. 11.6. 2. King. 2.11.</note> I anſwere, We know not. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinke they did, and that <hi>Elias</hi> in his fiery Chariot had his body burnt, and <hi>Enoch,</hi> who in his yeares matched the dayes of the Sunne 365. was without paine diſſolued, when God tooke his ſoule to heauen; or if they died not, yet (as <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith) the generall is not therefore falſe, becauſe God hath diſpenced in ſome particulers, though one or two died not, yet this is an vniuerſall truth of all men to be receiued,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1365:33"/> and duely pondered. <note place="margin">Heb. 9.21.</note> 
                  <hi>It is appointed vnto all men that they ſhall once die,</hi> from which there is no auoidance. For the Lord of life and death hath ſo decreed it; the decree was made in the beginning: <note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> 
                  <hi>For duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt returne.</hi> If it be his decree, it muſt needs haue a certaine effect. The decree is certaine, the euent is ineuitable. <hi>Our God</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3.</note> 
                  <hi>is in heauen, and hee doth whatſoeuer hee will.</hi> Gods will is the deede (as ſaith Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi>) if he hath once willed it, it is as good as wrought. If he haue decreed it, it is as certaine as if it were done. It is heauens decree, and it cannot be reuoked.<note place="margin">Dan. 6.1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I haue beene ſomewhat too tedious in this firſt Diuiſion, which is ſomwhat contrarie to the common prouerbe, that he ſhould not be tedious that reades a Lecture of mortality, but becauſe this is on the one ſide a matter worthy to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: and on the otherſide, a matter too too much negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, I haue beene ſomewhat the bolder to inſiſt the longer vpon it.

               <p>It is therefore a care that euery one ought to haue, <hi>viz.</hi> to know that they muſt die, and that they cannot auoid it. The decree is gone out againſt them, from the higheſt court of Parliament of the moſt High. What contempt were it not to take notice of it?</p>
               <p>Euery one therfore ought to labour to number his daies, and truely to know his mortalitie, the greateſt as well as the meaneſt, the wiſeſt as the ſimpleſt. For if any one, then all, and if any more then other, then the greateſt, for the greateſt are moſt ſubiect to death. As they challenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be the fineſt of the common mould, ſo they muſt know, that, by that they are not exempted from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of Nature, and force of Gods decree. But as, the finer the mettall, or the purer the matter of any glaſſe or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then veſſell is, the more ſubiect it is to breaking, and ſo the daintieſt bodies the ſooneſt gone. It behoueth vs all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſeeke for ſpirituall Arithmeticke, thereby to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1365:34"/> our dayes in a religious meditation of the incertainties of the time and the certaintie that that time will come. Let vs therefore liue to die, yea liue the life of grace, that wee may liue the life of glory. And then though we muſt go to the dead, yet we ſhall riſe from the dead, and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth liue with our God out of the reach of Death for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

               <head>THE SECOND DIVISION, ON THE MEDITATION OF DEATH.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen if Death be thus certaine, in the next place the law of reaſon aduiſeth vs to thinke of the worlds vanitie to contemne it, of death to expect it, of iudgement to auoid it, of hell to eſcape it, and of heauen to deſire it. And thinke it not needleſſe or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to bee exhorted to this Meditation; that the ignorant may learne, the careleſſe conſider, and the forgetfull remember that they all muſt die. For, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, nothing ſo recalleth a man from ſinne, as the frequent remembrance of death. For the error of all men, for the moſt part, taketh his originall from hence, that they forget the end of their life, which they ought alwayes to haue before their eyes. And of the want of this commeth pride, ambition, vaine-glory, too much carefulneſſe of the body, too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and caring after the things of this life. Hence alſo it commeth that we build Towers vpon the ſand. For if wee did conſider what we ſhall be after a few dayes, our manner of liuing would perhaps bee more humble, temperate and godly,: for who would haue a high looke, <note place="margin">Pſal. 131.1.</note> and a proud ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, if hee did with the eyes of his minde behold what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1365:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> manner of one he ſhortly after ſhall be in his graue? who would then worſhip his belly for a god, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> when he waigheth with himſelfe that the ſame muſt in ſhort time be wormes meate? who would be ſo in loue with money, that he would runne like a mad-man by ſea and land (as it were through fire and water) if he vnderſtood that he muſt leaue all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him?</p>
               <p>If this were well thought vpon, our errors would ſoone be corrected, and our liues bettered. Wiſh therefore rather for a good, then a long life. It is a thing doubtleſſe, worthy of euery mans beſt thoughts and intentions. For ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man muſt die, and hath a courſe to finiſh, which being finiſhed, hee muſt away. It is ſpeciall wiſdome to learne to know the length of his dayes, as it were the length of his leaſe: for as he hath vſed himſelfe in his farme, he ſhall enter at the expiration of his time vpon a better or a worſe.</p>

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> for his learning a Prophet, for his acceptation, <hi>a man after Gods owne heart,</hi> for his authority a King, was then very ſtudious in this knowledge, when after faſting and watching, he beſought God to be inſtructed in it. <hi>Lord let me know my end,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and the meaſure of my dayes, what it is, let me know how long I haue to liue.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Act. 7.22.</note> So <hi>Moſes,</hi> wiſe in all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Egypt and Iſrael, accounted faithfull in the houſe of God, <note place="margin">Heb. 3.2.</note> prayed yet for this point of wiſdome to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in it, <note place="margin">Pſal. 90.12.</note> and as well for himſelfe as others. <hi>Teach vs ſo to number our daies</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we may apply our hearts vnto wiſdome:</hi> like carefull ſchollers, who forſake their meat and drinke, and breake their ſleepe, and are often in meditation when they beate vpon ſome ſerious ſubiect.</p>
               <p>What thinke you it will profit a man, if by his skill in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetike, hee be able to deale with euery number, and to diuide the leaſt fractions, and neuer to thinke on the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of his daies with the men of God, and yet his dayes are few and euill?</p>
               <p>What will it profit him, if by Geometrie hee bee able to take the longitude of moſt ſpatious proſpects, and not be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1365:35"/> able to meaſure that which the Prophet hath meaſured with his ſpanne?<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.51.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What will it auaile him, if with the aſtronomer he be able to obſerue and know the motions of the heauens, and yet haue his heart ſo buried in the earth, that hee cannot thinke of that which paſſeth away as ſwiftly as any motion of them all?</p>
               <p>What profiteth it (I ſay) If he be able, with the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to ſearch out the cauſes of many effects, and to know the cauſes of many changes, as of the ebbing and flowing of the ſeas the increaſing and wayning of the Moone, and the like, and be not able to know his owne changes, and the cauſes of them? Doubtleſſe all this wil profit them nothing, all this knowledge will be to little purpoſe in the end. And vnleſſe they think vpon death, they cannot apply and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelues to a godly life. Yea we finde daily by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the forgetfulneſſe of death maketh vs applie our hearts to all kinde of folly and vanity.</p>
               <p>The holy men in old time were wont to keepe ſuch an account of their dayes, and ſo to think on death, that aboue all things they might apply their hearts vnto wiſdome. So mindfull of theſe things was Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> who ſaith of himſelfe, that whether he did eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer elſe he did, he thought alwaies this ſound of the laſt trumpet did euer ring in his eares. <hi>Ariſe yee dead, and come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Which when I conſider (ſaith he) it makes me ſhake and quake and not dare to commit ſinne, which otherwiſe I ſhould haue committed.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe that ancient and reuerend father <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth, was ſo carefull to auoid the vengeance to come that to ſtirre vp all the powers and faculties of his minde, with due conſideration of the vanitie of this world, the vileneſſe of his nature, the ſhortneſſe of his time, the cauſes of ſinne, and the puniſhment for the ſame, he ſtill imagined to heare a damned ſoule anſwere his demand, as followeth, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an interlocution or dialogue.

                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> that mighty Monarch and Emperor of the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1365:36"/> (beholding from a high place) the hugeneſſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in ſtrength inuincible, in quality diuers, in number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, in whoſe courage and might he had fully repoſed the ſtrength of his Kingdome, the ſafegard of his perſon, and glory of his Empire, could not refraine his eyes from teares, conſidering that of all this maruelous multitude which hee ſaw, that after one hundred yeares, there ſhould not a man be left. And ſhall we that are Chriſtians, (at leaſt wiſe by name) viewing from the higheſt pinnacle of our conceit, our ſelues, our glory, magnificence and renowne, our wealth, our ſtrength, our freinds, our health, and all our brauery, wherein we repoſe all our felicity and happineſſe, be nothing moued with the due conſideration of our Death, and with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away of the world, and the concupiſcence thereof? Therefore ſaith <hi>Martial</hi> an antient Biſhop, what haue we to doe with the delight of the world, that it ſhould hinder vs from the meditation on Death? You may call it as you will, either pleaſure, paſtime, gladneſſe, mirth, ioy: but in Gods dictionary it hath no ſuch name, in the holy ſcripture it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe called. It is called <hi>Adams</hi> goodlie apple, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.17. Gen. 25.30. 1 Sam. 14 43. Ioh. 13.27. Reu. 1. Luk. 15.16.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten, depriued him of paradiſe. <hi>Eſaus</hi> redde broath, which being ſupt vp bereaued him of his birthright. <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> ſweete honycombe, which being but taſted, was like to coſt him his life. Thus is all the delight in the world called in Gods dictionarie. It is called <hi>Adams</hi> apple, <hi>Eſaus</hi> broath, <hi>Ionathans</hi> hony-combe. So that all this delight is no delight, or ſuppoſe it were, yet certainely it ſhall not giue thee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of thy heart.</p>
               <p>As any ſolide body, though it haue neuer ſo faire a colour, as crimſon, or cornation, or purple, or ſcarlet, or violet, or ſuch like, yet alwaies the ſhadow of it is black, ſo any earthly thing, though it haue neuer ſo faire a ſhew yet alwaies the ſhadow of it is blacke, and the delight thou takeſt in it ſhall prooue to be grieuous in the end when thou muſt leaue all. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it a ſweete bitter thing; ſo likewiſe if we meditate on Death, it will make vs to call all theſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1365:37"/> things of the world not ſweet but bitter. And it would make vs ſay with the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> God forbid that I ſhould delight in any thing but in the croſſe and death of Chriſt by which the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world.</p>
               <p>But of all arithmeticall rules, this is the hardeſt, to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our daies. Men can number their heards and droues of Oxen and ſheepe, they can account the reuenues of their lands and farmes, they can with a little paines number their coyne and gaines, &amp; yet they are perſwaded that their daies are infinit and innumerable, and therefore they neuer begin to number, nor thinke on them for the which they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find any leaſure. Who ſaith not vpon the view of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſurely yonder man looketh by his countenance as if he would not liue long, yonder woman is old, her daies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be many? Thus we can number the dayes and yeares of others, and vtterly forget our owne. But the true wiſdome of mortall men is to number their owne daies, and like skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Geometricians to meaſure all their actions, all their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, all their cares and indeauours, all their thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and all their counſells by their departure out of this life (as the end whereunto they are reſerued) as it were by a certaine rule, and thereunto to direct all things, and ſo to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the courſe of our life which God hath giuen vs, that at laſt we may come to the hauen of eternall reſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p>What if we had dyed in the dayes of ignorance, like <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that hanged himſelfe before he could ſee the paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, or aſcenſion of Ieſus Chriſt? We ſhould then haue numbred our daies and our ſinnes too. But alaſſe how many dayes haue we ſpent, and yet neuer thought why one day was giuen vs? But as the old yeare went, and an other came, ſo we thought that a new would follow that, and ſo we thinke that another will follow this, and God knoweth how ſoone wee ſhall be deceiued. For ſo thought many of them before, who are now in their graues.</p>
               <p>Dearely beloued, this is not to number our dayes, but to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1365:37"/> prouoke God to ſhorten our dayes. I that write, you that read, and all that heare this, which of vs hath not liued twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres, yea ſome forty, fiftie, or more, and yet wee haue neuer ſeriouſly thought on Death, nor applyed our hearts aright vnto wiſdome. O if we had learned but euery yeere one vertue, ſince wee were borne, we might by this time haue bene like Saints amongſt men, whereas if God at this preſent time ſhould call vs to iudgment, it would appeare that we had applyed our hearts, mindes, memories, hands, feete, tongues, and all our whole bodies to all kinde of ſinne and wickedneſſe, but not applyed our ſelues at all to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, godlineſſe, vertue, and true piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> was wont to walke amongſt the graues, that he might become a right Philoſopher; for true philoſophie (ſaith <hi>Plato</hi>) is the meditation on death; and thou which art inſtructed in the true Chriſtian Philoſophie, how canſt thou behold the bones of the dead, but thou muſt needs fall into this patheticall meditation with thy ſelfe. Behold theſe legges that haue made ſo many iourneyes, this head which is the receptacle of wiſdome, &amp; remembreth ſo many things, muſt ſhortly be as this bare skull and dry bones are. I will therefore betimes bid worldly vanities <hi>adieu,</hi> betake my ſelfe to repentance, and newneſſe of life, and ſpend the reſt of my dayes in the ſeruice of my God, and continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on my ende.</p>
               <p>As the laſt day of our life leaueth vs, ſo ſhall that laſt day the day of Chriſts comming finde vs. How good were it therefore before we run into deſperate arrerages, to caſt vp our bils of accompt, and the rather becauſe we ſhall be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of our office we know not how ſoone. <note place="margin">Luke 16.2.</note> Some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors amongſt the heathen (as bookes ſay) were wont to be crowned ouer the graues, and ſepulchers of dead men, to teach them by the certaine but vnknowne end of their ſhort life, to vſe their great roomes, as men that muſt one day be as they are, whoſe graues they tread vpon.</p>
               <p>The old Saints, who liued in a continuall meditation of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1365:38"/> their ſhort and vncertaine time, were wont alwayes like wiſe merchants to think of their returne homeward; and therfore tooke vp their treaſure by bils of payment, not where they were, but where they would be, and meant to make their long aboade, that is meant to be for euer. And the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (who ſaw not beyond the clouds of humane reaſon) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceiued how much men did decline by courſe of yeares &amp; waſt of time, were wont to ſay that the life of a wiſe man was nothing elſe but a continuall meditation on death; the remembrance whereof made the world (which wee for want of this meditation ſo willingly embrace) vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible vnto them; and auayled greatly to guide them in all godlines. So a Chriſtian mans life is, or ſhould be nothing els, but a continuall meditation on death.</p>
               <p>All that is within vs, and without vs, are ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances of Death, all things crye out vnto vs that we muſt hence, <note place="margin">Ioh. 8.23.</note> as Chriſt cryed, <hi>I am not of this world.</hi> The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell which we weare vpon our backs, <note place="margin">Ioh. 17.14.</note> the meate diſgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and egeſted, and returning to putrefaction, the graues ſhrouding ſo many corpes vnder our feete, time the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all things, and the changeable ſtate of times, euen winter and ſommer, cold and heat, ſeede time and harueſt, all doe crie vnto vs that wee ſhall weare away, and dy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. As they who were liuing are now dead, and lye in the duſt, firſt we wax dry, then old, then cold, then ſicke, then dead. So that euery thing doth ſerue to put vs in minde, that our bodies which wee beare about vs, are mortall; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on our table we haue moments of Death; for we eate not the creatures till they be dead, our garments are either the skinnes or excrements of dead beaſts; we often follow the dead corps to the graue, and often walke ouer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in Churches &amp; Church-yards, eſpecially men that doe vſe to walke there, ſhall doe well to remember that they treade vpon the dead, and others ſhortly muſt tread vpon them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer in great Citties wee haue almoſt euery day
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1365:38"/> Death rung in our eares, the deadly bell telleth vs, that duſt wee are, and to duſt wee muſt goe againe. To this perhaps the old Oracle hath reference, of whom the Philoſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> (being deſirous to chuſe the moſt honeſt and beſt rule for the direction of this life) demaunded as the manner then was, his opinion therein, and receiued this anſwer. <hi>That if he would frame the courſe of his life aright, he ſhould vſe the commerce &amp; ſociety of the dead.</hi> And the Church-yards which are the howſes of Chriſtians, and as it were the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or beds to ſleepe in, they are the places to which wee may reſort to be put in minde of our mortalitie and future mutability.</p>
               <p>But we Chriſtians haue in ſtead of commerce and ſocietie with the dead, <note place="margin">Luk. 16.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Moſes and the Prophets</hi> to put vs in minde of our death; and if we will not heare them, <note place="margin">Ezeck 3.7.</note> neither will we be perſwaded, though one riſe from the dead to tell vs of our death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> knew all the beaſts, &amp; called them by their names but his owne name he forgot. <hi>Adam of earth.</hi> What bad memories haue wee, that forget our owne names, and our ſelues, that we are the ſonnes of men corruptible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? Proud man (I ſay) forgets this ſentence, that earth is his natiue wombe, when he was borne, and that being dead, the earth is his tombe.</p>
               <p>When we looke to the earth, it ſhould put vs in minde, that earth we were, earth we are, and earth we ſhall be; the earth prouides for our neceſſity, and feeds vs with her fruits; neither in life nor death doth ſhe forſake vs; while we liue, ſhe ſuffers vs to make long furrowes on her back, and when we dy, her bowels are digged vp, and ſhe receiueth vs into her boſome; here now a pit is digged ſeuen or eight foote long, and ſo as it may ſerue for <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, whom liuing, the world could not containe And how loftie ſoeuer men looke, death onely ſhewes how little their bodies are, which ſo ſmall a peece of earth will containe whom before nothing would content; and therein the dead carkaſſe is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1365:39"/> content to dwell, whom at his comming the wormes doe welcome, and the bones of other dead men are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue place. And in this houſe of obliuion and ſilence the carcaſſe being woond in a ſheete, and bound hand and foote, is ſhut vp though it neede not to haue ſo great labour beſtowed vpon it, for it would not run away out of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though the hands and feete were looſe.</p>
               <p>And now if we doe but conſider a little of the tombes of noble men and Princes, whoſe glory and maieſtie wee haue ſeene when they liued here on earth, and doe behold the skill and ſillie formes and ſhapes, which they now haue, ſhall wee not cry out as men amaſed? Is this that glory, that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and excellencie. Whether now are the degrees of their waiting ſeruants gone? Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

All theſe things are vaniſhed away like the ſmoake, and nothing is now left but duſt, horror and rottenneſſe; ſuch is mans body now become; yea though it were the body of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, King, or Monarch, where is now that maieſtie, that excellencie, and authoritie, which it had before time, when men trembled to behold it, and might not come in preſence without all reuerence and obeyſance. Where are all theſe things become? Were they a dreame or ſhadowe? After all theſe things the funerall is prepared, which is all that men can carry with them of their riches and kingdomes; and this alſo they ſhould not haue, if in their life time they did not appoynt it for their dignitie and honor. For the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.16.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Bee not then afraid though one be made rich, or if the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his houſe be increaſed; for he ſhall carry away nothing with him when he dyeth, neither ſhall his pompe follow him.</hi> O would wee could but conſider the equall neceſſity of dying in all, and the like putrefaction in all being dead. This would plant in our hearts true humility, if we call to minde what we are now, and what we ſhall be ſhortly. We are now in our beſt eſtate but as a dunghill couered with ſnowe, which vvhen Death ſhall diſſolue, there ſhall nothing be ſeene of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1365:39"/> all our pompe and glory, but duſt, rottenneſſe, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The conſideration of all which things as a dyall putteth vs in minde that wee muſt all hence; when we haue runne our certaine race in an vncertaine time; the courſe whereof becauſe it ſhall be intercepted, not when we pleaſe, but when the Lord will, it is good that we be forewarned to meditate on Death, that we may be the better armed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with Death when it comes.</p>
               <p>When wee looke to the waters to ſee how ſwiftly they runne, let vs thinke, that ſo our life paſſeth; when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the foules flying in the ayre, whoſe paſſage is not ſeene, ſo is the path of our life. When we ſee the Sunne and the Moone how they haſten their courſe, euen ſo doe we. We can turne our ſelues no way, but ſomething there is which may put vs in minde of our mortality. Caſt your eye vpon your houreglaſſe, and conſider that as the hower ſo paſſeth our life. Sit in your chaire by the fire, and ſee much wood turned into ſmoake and aſhes, and ſay with the Poet. <hi>Sic in non hominem veritur omnis homo.</hi> So man will ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become no man. See in the fields ſome graſſe comming, <note place="margin">Eſa. 40.6.</note> ſome come already, and ſome withered and gone, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe with the Prophet that <hi>all fleſh is graſſe, and all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof as a flower of the field;</hi> when the ayre moues, and the winde beates in your face, remember that the breath of man is in his noſtrels, which being ſtopt his breath is gone, and that the ſtrongeſt tenor of your life is but by a puffe of winde. Standing by the riuers ſide, <note place="margin">Eſay 2.22.</note> confeſſe that as the riuer runneth, and doth not returne, ſo doth your life. As the arrow which you ſee flye in the aire, ſo ſwiftly conclude that your daies doe paſſe. <note place="margin">Pſal. 32.9.</note> Or if we be like horſe or mule without vnderſtanding to conſider this, yet I am ſure, wee cannot be ſo ſenceleſſe as to conſider that which euery dayes light preſenteth to our view. And ſurely if we goe no further then our owne ſelues, and conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes we continually carry about vs, what aches affect our bones, what heauineſſe our bodies, what dimneſſe our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1365:40"/> eyes, what deafeneſſe our eares, what trembling our hands, what rottenneſſe our teeth, what baldneſſe our heads, what grayneſſe our haires; all and euery one of theſe, as ſo many loud alarums would ſound vnto vs, Death is neere. Or if none of theſe did affect vs within, yet how many thouſand dangers doe daily threaten vs without, and ſeeme to ſhew vs preſent death: ſitting on horſe-back, in the ſlipping of one foot thy life is in danger: by an iron toole or weapon in thine owne or thy friends hand, a miſchance, and that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may happen. The wilde beaſtes, which thou ſeeſt, are armed to thy deſtruction. If thou ſhut vp thy ſelfe in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den well fenced, where nothing appeares but ſweete ayre, and that which is pleaſant, there perhaps lurketh ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous or venimous Serpent. Thy houſe ſubiect to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all windes and ſtormes, doth threaten thee with falling on thy head. I ſpeake not of poiſonings, treaſons, robberies, open violence, of which, part doe beſiege vs at home, and part doe follow vs abroad. Examples tending to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are infinite; whereof ſome haue beene mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the former Diuiſion: and I will produce heere ſome few more, thereby to put vs in minde that the ſame things may happen to our ſelues. For which cauſe, hardly ſhould a moment of our life be ſpent without due conſideration of our death.</p>
               <p>If then we aſcend the Theatre of mans life, and looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, we ſhal ſee ſome to haue periſhed with ſodaine death; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira:</hi> others with griefe, <hi>Ely:</hi> others with ioy, <hi>Rodius Diagoras:</hi> others with gluttony, <hi>Domitius Afer:</hi> others with drunkenneſſe, <hi>Attilla</hi> King of Hunnes: others with hunger, <hi>Cleanthus:</hi> others with thirſt, <hi>Thales Mileſius:</hi> others in their laſciuious daliances, <hi>Cornelius Gallus:</hi> others with ouer-watching, <hi>M.

I ſpeake nothing of others, who haue vntimely periſhed, ſome by one meanes, ſome by another. What ſhal I ſay then? doe ſo many things within vs, ſo many things without vs, ſo many about vs threaten continuall death vnto vs? Then wretched man thou art, that doeſt not meditate on theſe things, ſeeing thou art ſo neere thy death, and muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth of <hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> a King of the Egyptians, that he was carried in a Chariot drawne with foure Kings, whom he before had conquered: One of the foure caſting his eyes behind, looked often vpon the wheeles of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, &amp; was at length demanded by <hi>Seſoſtris</hi> what he meant to looke backe ſo often.

               <p>As a birde guideth her flight with her traine, ſo the life of man is beſt directed by continuall recourſe to his end. Doe we not know by Scripture, that death ſtealeth vpon vs, as trauell vpon a woman, or as a theefe in the night, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no warning.

               <p>Wee had need of monitors, of <hi>Philips</hi> boyes to put vs in minde of our end: not the oldeſt man, but thinkes he ſhall liue a yeere: and the yong man in the April of his age, when his breaſts are full of milke, and his bones runne full of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, full little thinkes of the ſlimie valley, and that he ſhall ſhortly remaine in the heapes.</p>

               <p>When thou goeſt to bed, and art putting off thy cloathes remember and meditate that the day commeth when thou muſt be as barely vnſtript of all that thou haſt in the world, as now thou art of thy cloathes. And when thou ſeeſt thy bed let it put thee in minde of thy graue, which is now the bed of Chriſt, which he hath ſanctified and warmed for the bodies of his deere children to reſt in; and let thy bed-cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes repreſent vnto thee the mould of the earth that ſhall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thee, thy ſheets, thy winding ſheete, thy ſleepe thy death, thy waking thy reſurrection, for when wee riſe in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we muſt remember thereby that we ſhall riſe out of the graue of the earth at the laſt day.

But the truth is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our ſelues doe ſhorten our liues, with ryot, idleneſſe, diſſoluteneſſe, and exceſſe. Kingly treaſures committed to euill husbands, are quickly waſted.

               <p>For to ſpeake as the truth is, and as the matter deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ueth, we liue not, but linger out a few dolorous daies.

                  <hi>Thou foole this night they will fetch away thy ſoule from thee, then whoſe ſhall theſe things be, which thou haſt thus ſcraped and gathered together?</hi> Then would they conſider that death will depriue them of all their treaſures, their houſes which they haue builded by fraud, their rents, for which they haue made ſhipwracke of their ſoules, their fields, which they haue gotten by deceit, their ſiluer and gold, which they haue gotten by vſury and oppreſſion, their life which they haue ſo lewdly and vnprofitably ſpent, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their pleaſures their Paradiſe, and their gold their god Then ſhall they perceiue their error, that they haue choſen droſſe for gold, graſſe for grace, ruſt for ſiluer, loſſe for gain, ſhame for honor, paine for reſt, yea for heauen hell. Come alſo to this ſchoole of the meditation on Death, you drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards, ſwearers, whore-mongers, blaſphemers, ſwaggerers, prophaners of Gods Sabbathes, and all carnall, riotous and vngodly liuers, ſmall pleaſures would you take in theſe vices, nay, ſoone would yee leaue and forſake them, if you would giue your ſelues to this meditation.</p>
               <p>The ancient Egyptians well knew the force of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, who in the middeſt of their mirth at their ſolemne Feaſts, were wont to haue the image of Death brought in and laid before them, with theſe words; <hi>Hoc intuens epulare:</hi> beholding this Image, eate and drinke, but within the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1365:43"/> bounds of temperance; for you muſt all be as this dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe is, whereſoeuer yee goe. But if we carry not with vs the vglie picture of Death, yet let vs carry in our hearts the true picture of our Death, and then this meditation will correct and amend theſe vices in vs. It is written of thoſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, called <hi>Brackmani</hi> that they were ſo much giuen to thinke vpon their end that they had their graues alwaies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before their gates, that both going out and comming in they might alwaies be mindfull of their Death and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the tyrant cauſed his notable flatterer <hi>Damocles</hi> (who affirmed the life of a King to be moſt happie) to be ſet in his regall Throne in ſtately robes and all Princely cheere, and dainty fare before him, and a naked ſword tyed but with a horſe-haire to hang ouer his head, menacing him Death. Could this Paraſite (thinke you) take any delight in this princely fare and pompe? No verily, but as if he had ſat amongſt the greateſt hagges of hell, he durſt not once touch the dainty diſhes before him; and ſhall not the meditation on Death either preſent or hard at hand, and the ſword of the wrathfull Iudge drawne and hanging ouer thine head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine thee from immoderate and ſuperfluous eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>It is recorded alſo of a certaine King whoſe minde was ſo fixed in the deepe meditation on Death, that thereby hee became more ſober and modeſt in all his actions, who being incited by his Ieſter or Paraſite to be merry, banquet and carowſe; hee commanded his Paraſite to be ſet on a ſeate made with rotten wood, fire to be put vnder, and a ſword to hang ouer his head, and alſo princely diſhes to be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and willed him to eate, drinke and be merry, but this ſtomacke would not ſerue him ſo much as to taſt one of thefe dainty diſhes; and wilt thou O drunkard or glutton ſinne in exceſſe, and make thy belly thy God, who ſitteſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rotten body, with the fire of naturall heat continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuouring within it, which the fire of the elementarie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1365:44"/> qualities on euery ſide diſturbeth, hauing the <hi>Etna</hi> of hell beneath, and the ſword of Gods wrath aboue.</p>
               <p>Euen thus ſtandeth our caſe; a certaine diuine writer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this compariſon. A poore traueller purſued by an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne, by chance in his flight, ſlippes or falles into the ſide of a deepe pit or dungeon, which is full of cruell ſerpents, and in his fall catcheth hold by one ſmall twig of the arme of a tree. As hee thus hangeth, looking downeward, hee ſeeth two wormes gnawing at the roote of the tree, and looking vpward he ſees an hiue of ſweete hony, which makes him to climbe vp vnto it, and to ſit and feede vpon it. While he thus feedeth himſelfe, and becommeth ſecure and careleſſe of what may come, the Vnicorne being hunger-bitten, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and bruſing on other boughes, is each moment ready to crop of the twigge whereon this wretched man ſitteth. Now in what wofull plight is this diſtreſſed creature? Then after this the two wormes gnawe in ſunder the roote of the tree, which falling downe, both man and tree fall into the bottom of that deepe pit. This hungry Vnicorne is ſwift death, the poore traueller that flyeth is euery ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the pit ouer which he hangeth is hell, the arme of the tree and ſlender twigge is his fraile and ſhort life, thoſe two wormes are the wormes of conſcience, which day and night without intermiſſion conſume the ſame, the hiue of hony is the pleaſures of this world, to which while men wholly deuote themſelues (not remembring their laſt end) the roote of the tree, that is the temporall life is ſpent, and they fall without redemption into the pit and gulfe of hell. If thou thus ſeriouſly ponder this thy vnſtable eſtate, I ſuppoſe thou wilt take little pleaſure in ryot and diſſolute liuing.</p>
               <p>Giue thoſe that are condemned to dy, <hi>Nectar,</hi> giue them <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> giue them <hi>Manna,</hi> the bread of Angells, and will they taſt it? No, they can neither eat, drinke, laugh or ſleepe, and wilt thou that art already condemned and guiltie of death (perchance) this very moment to be inflicted vpon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1365:44"/> thee, ſecurely addict thy ſelfe to drunkenneſſe, gluttonie, exceſſe, and to al manner of riotous and intemperate liuing? Remember rather the rich glutton in the Goſpell, <note place="margin">Luke 16.23.</note> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had pampered his body all the dayes of his life, in the end Death made him a fat diſh for the wormes, his fleſh and bones were conſumed into duſt, but (which was moſt terrible) his ſoule was caſt into hell, the burning lake of brimſtone, and at this time calleth for one drop of cold water to coole his tongue, which yet is denied him.</p>
               <p>What adamantine and flinty heart can thinke vpon this without relenting? I ſpeake not here of the harmes and hurts that intemperance in meates and drinkes bringeth to the body, for meate ſhould be vſed as oyle put into a lampe, to keepe it burning, not to quench it. And <hi>Galen</hi> the Prince of Phyſitians ſaith that abſtinence is the whole ſumme or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of Phyſicke. How then can they liue long, that liue by ſo many deaths, whoſe bellies are ſepulchers of luſts, and very gulfes and ſinckes of the ſhambles, to their owne deſtruction? For as he that allowes leſſe to his body then he owes to his body, kils his friend, ſo hee that giues more to his body then he owes to his body, nouriſheth his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. If the glutton did remember that God is able to come againſt him, yea at the very disburdening of nature, he would not make his kitchin his Church, gurmandizing his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine, his Table his Alter, his Cooke his Preacher, the odours of his meate his ſacrifice, ſwearing his prayer, quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing his repentance, and his whole life wanton fare. Did the Drunkard but remember this; that God is ready to come quickly againſt him, yea euen in his drunkenneſſe, he would not riſe early to follow ſtrong drink, <note place="margin">Eſa. 5.11.</note> which doth trouble the head, ouerthrow the ſences, cauſe the feete to reele, the tongue to ſtammer, the eyes to roule, and the whole fabrick of his little world to be poſſeſt with this voluntarie madnes, loſſe of many friends, credit and time.</p>
               <p>It would make too great a volume to inſiſt vpon all other ſinnes; for the ſubduing wherof the meditation on Death is a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1365:45"/> moſt ſoueraigne remedy. Are we ſtrangers vpon earth and is our countrey in heauen, and muſt we all dye? Yea verily; this neceſſitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould inforce vs to aſpire to our heauenly countrey; and let vs rather meete Death in our meditation, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> careleſly attend it, leſt we be ſurprized by it at vnawares.</p>
               <p>Before thy miſerable ſpirit reſigne ouer his borrowed manſion, bethinke with thy ſelfe what thou art, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt, the remembrance whereof will breede in thy heart ſorrow, ſorrow remorſe, remorſe repentance, repentance humilty, humility godly affection, and loue to God-ward. And here aſſure thy ſelfe, that nothing in all the world can inforce a man ſooner to liue ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent euill life, then the due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne infirmities, the certaine knowledge of his mortality, and the often and continuall meditation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his laſt gaſpe, death and diſſolution, when as a man then becommeth no man. For when once he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to wax ſicke, and ſtill by ſicknes groweth more ſickly, then doth a wretched man deſpaire of life, hauing onely his paine &amp; griefe in remembrance. His heart doth quake, his minde is amazed with feare, his ſences vaniſh quite away, his ſtrength decayes, his carefull breſt doth pant, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance is pale, neither willing nor able to call for mercy, his fauor out of fauor, his eares deafe, his noſe loathſomely foule and ſharp, his tongue furred with phlegme and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler quite flattereth and faileth, his mouth vnſeemely froa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and foming, his body dyeth and rots, at length his fleſh conſumes, his ſhape, his beautie, his delicacy leaue him, and he returnes to aſhes, and in ſtead and place of theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede filthy wormes, as one ſayth elegantly.
<q>
                     <l>Next after man doe wormes ſuccede,</l>
                     <l>then ſtincke in his degree,</l>
                     <l>So euery man to no man muſt</l>
                     <l>returne by Gods decree.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Behold here a ſpectacle both ſtrange and dreadfull, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1365:45"/> aſſure thy ſelfe that there is neither skill nor meanes of art nor any kinde of learning that can be more auaileable to quaile the pride of man, conuince his malice, confound his luſts, and abate his worldly pompe, and vaine-glorious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then the often remembring of theſe things. For in all the world there is nothing ſo irkſome, nothing ſo loathſome, and vile as the carcaſſe of a dead man, whoſe ſent is ſo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infectious, that it may not lodge and continue in a houſe fower dayes, but muſt needs be caſt out of doores as dung, and deepely buried in the mould, <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.39.</note> for feare of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ayre. Then bluſh for ſhame thou proud peacocke, who in death art ſo vile, and wormes meat, and ſhortly ſhall become moſt loathſome carrion.</p>
               <p>Thinke therefore vpon theſe things, and thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great profit thereby. When the Peacocke doth behold that comely fanne and circle of the beautifull feathers of his taile, hee jetteth vp and downe in pride, beholding euery part thereof, but when he looketh downe &amp; ſeeth his black feete with great miſliking he vaileth his top-gallant, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſorrow. Euen ſo many know by experience that when they ſee themſelues to abound in wealth and honor, they glory much &amp; are highly conceited of themſelues, they draw plots, and appoynt much for themſelues to performe for many yeares to come. This yeare (ſay they) we will beare this office, and the next yeare that, afterward we ſhall haue the rule of ſuch a prouince, then wee will build a pallace in ſuch a Citty, whereunto wee will adioyne ſuch gardens of pleaſure, and ſuch vineyards, and the like. And thus they make a very large reckoning before hand with the rich man in the Goſpell. Who if they did but once behold their feete, that is, if they did but ſee how faſt they ſtoope toward death, <note place="margin">Luk. 12.16.</note> and conſidered the ſhortneſſe of their life, ſo fraile, ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and tranſitorie, and vpon Death ſo black and vgly, how ſoone would they let fall their proud plumes, forſake their arrogancy, and change their purpoſes, their manners, their mindes, their liues? In that they tend and haſten as faſt as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1365:46"/> they can to death, ſome at one miles end, ſome at two, ſome at three, and ſome when they haue gone a little further. And thus it commeth to paſſe that ſome are taken out of this life ſooner, and ſome tarry a little longer. Abhorre therefore thy haughtines, auoid thy vanities, leaue off thy luſts, &amp; amend thy life. For he that is godly wiſe vieweth his death preſent, and by the meditation and remembrance thereof he armeth himſelfe to amend.</p>
               <p>If the greateſt man in the world doe in a holy meditation ſtrip himſelfe out of his robes and ornaments of ſtate, and haue the ſcanning of this one poynt often in his minde; hence I muſt, as great as I am, and whether then? Like men who trauelling, no ſooner come to their lodging, but they are talking of their next Inne, the debating of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the minde would bring forth moſt excellent fruite; and ſo likewiſe if euery man would thus meditate and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I muſt remoue, and whither then? Hell is my deſert, how ſhall I eſcape it? Heauen is the onely place I deſire to goe to, how ſhall I come to it? And thus one good meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and thought would make way for another, and ſo lead vs on by degrees vnto the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Marke the life and behauiour of the wicked to auoid their ſteps, and of the godly to prouoke thy ſelfe to a holy imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the like courſe; as a thing beſt pleaſing to God. It is one way whereby wee honor thoſe that are departed in the faith, when wee reſemble them in thoſe heauenly graces, which (like the ſtars of heauen) did ſhine within them, while they were aliue. Mark alſo their death with like diligence, &amp; think ſeriouſly vpon thy owne death, how thou muſt ſhortly dye and lie downe in the duſt, and part with whatſoeuer delight thou doeſt here enioy, that this may breede in thee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and a longing after a better life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaid that the life of a wiſe man muſt be a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall meditation on Death, and he onely is euer carefull to doe well, who is euer thinking on his laſt end.</p>
               <p>It were good that Chriſtians, which tender their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1365:46"/> would among ſo many houres of the day as they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in idle, vaine and wandring thoughts, talke, play or fruitleſſe exerciſe, imploy but an houre of the day, after the example of a holy man, in reading, meditating and ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of one little booke <hi>(trium foliorum)</hi> but of three leaues, which I wil commit to your Chriſtian co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration. I haue read of a certaine holy man, who at firſt had led a diſſolute life, and chancing on a time into the company of an honeſt godly man, he in ſhort time ſo wrought by his holy perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with his affections (ſuch is the force of godly ſocietie) that he vtterly renounced his former courſe of life, and gaue himſelfe to a more priuate, auſtere, moderate and ſecluſe kinde of liuing; the cauſe whereof being demanded by one of his former companions, who would haue drawne him (ſuch is the nature of euill company) to his vſuall riot, hee anſwered, that as yet he was ſo buſied in reading and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on a little booke, which was but of three leaues, that he had no leiſure ſo much as to think of any other buſineſſe: and being asked againe, a long time after, whether hee had read ouer theſe three leaues; he did reply, that theſe three leaues were of three ſeuerall colours, red, white, and black, which contained ſo many miſteries, that the more he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated thereon, the more ſweetneſſe he alwayes found, ſo that he had deuoted himſelfe to reade therein all the daies of his life. In the firſt leafe which is red, I meditate (quoth he) on the Paſſion of my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and of his precious bloud ſhed for a ranſome of my ſinnes, and the ſinnes of all his Elect, without which we had been all bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues to Satan, and fewell for hell fire. In the white leafe, I cheere vp my ſpirit with the comfortable conſideration of the vnſpeakable ioyes of the heauenly Kingdome, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the bloud of my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, a great motiue of thankfulneſſe. In the third leafe, which is blacke, I meditatate vpon the horrible and perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell for the wicked and reprobate prouided and kept in ſtore; who, if they behold the heauens, from thence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1365:47"/> they are iuſtly baniſhed for their ſinnes: If they looke vpon the earth, there are they impriſoned; on the right hand they haue the Saints, whoſe ſteps they haue not rightly followed; on the left hand the wicked, whoſe courſe they haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; before them, they haue Death ready to arreſt them; behind them, their wicked life ready to accuſe them; aboue them, Gods iuſtice ready to condemne them; and vnder them, Hell-fire, readie to deuoure them. From which the godly are freed by the death of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This booke of three leaues, if we would alwayes carrie in our hearts, and meditate often therein, aſſuredly great would be the benefit which we ſhould make thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine our thoughts, words and actions, within the bounds and limits of the feare of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.

For which of vs all can aſſure himſelfe of life till to morrow, or what if he ſhould liue one, two, three, foure or fiue yeeres longer, or what if twentie yeeres longer, who would not liue like a godly Chriſtian ſo many yeeres, for to liue in heauen with Chriſt for euer? Wee can be content to liue ſeuen yeeres Apprentiſe with great labour and toile, to bee inſtructed in ſome trade, that we may liue the more eaſily the reſt of our dayes; and about this we ſpend our thoughts and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cannot we then be well contented to labour a little while in the matters of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſpend our thoughts, endeauours and meditations therein, that we may reſt from all our labours for euer after in heauen.</p>

               <p>Which meditation on Death we muſt not make a naked diſcourſe, or bare reading onely, but a vehement applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the minde to the thing it ſelfe, with an inward ſence and feeling of the heart, all the diſtractions of our thoughts being abandoned. For meditation is an action or worke of the ſoule, bending it ſelfe often, earneſtly, and orderly to think vpon a thing; and it is either of Gods word or works, and Death is one of Gods workes, euen a worke of mercy, to his elect and choſen children, but a work of iuſtice to the vngodly and reprobate. Therefore that thou mayeſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate profitably on Death, whereby it may proue a worke of Gods mercie vnto thee, put thy ſelfe humbly in the ſight of God, who beholdeth thee in all thy actions, and thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, begge of him, that all thy thoughts, words and works,

               <head>THE THIRD DIVISION, OF THE PREPARATION FOR DEATH.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow by way of preparation vnto death, let vs obſerue that the greateſt worke we haue to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in this world is to die well; &amp; they which die well die not to die, but to liue eternally. That man doth finiſh his daies in his beſt ſort, that euery day eſteemeth the laſt day of his life to be preſent or neere at hand, and that a man may die well, Gods word requireth a preparation for Death.</p>
               <p>The Preparation for death is an action of a repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby he makes himſelfe fit and ready euery day to leaue this life, and to die well. And it is a dutie very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and of great waight and importance, to which we are tied and bound by Gods Commandement, and therefore it can in no wiſe bee omitted of him, that deſires to make a happie and bleſſed end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this preparation is two-fold, Generall and particular. Generall preparation is that whereby a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares himſelfe to die, through the whole courſe of his life. The reaſons are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Death which is certaine, is moſt vncertaine; I ſay it is certaine, becauſe no man can auoid it: and it is vncertaine three wayes. Firſt, in regard of the time, for no man doth know when he ſhall die. Secondly, in regard of the place, becauſe no man knoweth where he ſhall die: and thirdly, in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1365:49"/> regard of the kind of death, for that no man knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall die of an ordinary or extraordinary death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a lingring or ſodaine death, whether eaſie or violent. Therefore from thence it followes that we ſhould euery day and in all places prepare our ſelues for death.</p>
               <p>Indeede if wee could know when, where, and how wee ſhould dye, the caſe were otherwiſe; but ſeeing we know none of all theſe, but are ignorant therof, therfore it ſtands vs greatly in hand to looke about vs to prepare our ſelues for our latter end.</p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon ſeruing further to perſwade vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of this duety, is this, that the moſt dangerous thing in all the world to the hazard of our ſoules, is to neglect this preparation. It muſt not be put off till ſickneſſe, for then it will be vnfitting by reaſon of the paine, and of other lets and hinderances at that time. It muſt not be put off to bee done when we will, for it is not in the power of man, to doe this duetie at his pleaſure, but when God will. <note place="margin">Ier. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord</hi> ſaith the Prophet) <hi>I know that the way of man is not in himſelfe, it is not in man</hi> (that walketh) <hi>to direct his ſteps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, this late preparation, which conſiſteth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in repentance, is ſeldome or neuer true: It is ſicke like the partie himſelfe, commonly languiſhing and dying together with vs. This preparation ſhould bee voluntary (as all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God ought to bee) but preparation taken vp in ſickneſſe is vſually conſtrained and extorted by the feare of hell, and other iudgements of God. For in true and ſound preparation (wherein chiefely wee muſt repent) men muſt forſake all their ſinnes, but in this, the ſin forſakes the man, who leaues all his euill wayes only vpon this that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, whether he will or no, to leaue the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore ponder with thy ſelfe, what then thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt that thou hadeſt done, when being neere vnto death, thou haſt no more time to liue, and the ſame thing which thou wouldeſt wiſh thou hadeſt done, when thou art at the point of death, the ſame thing without delay doe, while thou
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1365:50"/> art in health, that thou maiſt be ready euery houre to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the meſſage of Death, as <hi>Seneca</hi> perſwades. <hi>Mors vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nos expectat, tu ſi ſapiens eris vbique eam expectabis,</hi> ſo it ſhall neuer take thee at any aduantage. To this end remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his admonition, be afraid to liue in ſuch an eſtate, as thou art afraid to dy in. And pray vnto God that by his grace theſe things may penetrate into the bottom of thy heart, and bee there ſo fixed, that they may neuer bee quenched; and that from this time forward thou maiſt make ſuch vſe of the preaching and hearing of his holy word, of the comfortable ſacraments of his Church, and all other the good meanes of thy ſaluation that thou maiſt begin to walke now with a better conſcience before him, that in the peace of a quiet conſcience (after this preparation) thou maiſt thereby arriue at the heauen of eternall glory and happines, and ſay with the bleſſed Apoſtle. <note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Herein doe I exerciſe my ſelfe to haue alwaies a good conſcience void of offence toward God and toward men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then this poynt being manifeſt, that a generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration muſt be made, let vs now ſee in what manner it muſt be done. And for the right doing of it fiue duties muſt be practiſed in the whole courſe of our liues. The firſt is the meditation on Death; for the life of a Chriſtian is nothing elſe (as was noted) at large in the ſecond diuiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.60.</note> who made his tombe in his life time in the midſt of his garden, to this end (no doubt) to put himſelfe in minde daily of his death, and that in the midſt of his delights and pleaſant walkes, hee might be the better prepared for Death.</p>
               <p>And in this reſpect a decent funerall is a dutie to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and a debt to be pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And likewiſe all the reſt of the Patriarches and holy men of God.</p>
               <p>This honor is to be giuen vnto the dead, which from the Church was deriued vnto the very gentiles with whom to violate the ſepulchers of the dead, was euer accounted an hainous offence, and the place of buriall ſacred. But God threatneth it is a iudgment to the wicked that they ſhall not be buried and lamented, and denounceth it twice as a great curſe againſt <hi>Iehoiakin</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> that hee ſhall bee buried as an Aſſe is buried, <note place="margin">Ier. 16.4.6. Ier 22 18.19. Ier. 36.30.</note> and that his dead body ſhall be caſt out with contempt without any pompe or decencie of buriall.</p>
               <p>It appeares alſo in <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that it was a cuſtome in old time to enterre valiant men in their armes, <note place="margin">Ezech. 32.27.</note> to put them into their graues with weapons of warre, and to bury them with their ſwords vnder their heads, which thing God ſeemes there to threaten that his enemies ſhall not haue; giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand that the hauing of ſuch funerall pome and ceremonies is an honor a worldly bleſſing and a gift of God of which he depriues his enemies, and therefore threatens in the next verſe that they ſhall ly by them that are ſlaine wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1365:51"/>
               <p>And although the wicked doe come to this honor of ſumptuous funerals, and to be laid in coſtly and painted tombes and ſepulchers (as it often falleth out) yet it may be ſaid of ſuch a one, that he which was not long ſince clad in ſilke, purple, and gold, and ſhined with diamonds, is now aſſaulted with troupes of wormes, and breathes forth intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable ſents; while that his heire liueth pleaſantly in ryot and exceſſe, poſſeſſing the fruite of his labours which hee himſelfe neuer, or a ſmall time enioyed. And herein his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duſt and corruption doth appeare, and his ambition, and pride doth reſt it ſelfe within this tombe; for then behold ſtately Sepulchers, engrauen ſtones, that report ſome famous actions, and proud titles vpon his tombe, ſet out with falſe narrations, to the end that paſſengers may ſay here lyeth a goodly ſtone, but a corrupted bodie.</p>
               <p>But the vſe that wee muſt make of all burialls and fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals for whomſoeuer they be, is to admoniſh and put vs in minde, that we muſt make preparation for our owne end, and for the felicitie &amp; happines of the life to come. Which kinde of preparation is of eſpeciall vſe and brings forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent fruits in the life of man. For a worldling ſurfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vanities, a proud man in the midſt of his aſpiring thoughts, the couetous man in the dogs-hunger of his aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, the voluptuous man in the fury of his fornication, the enuious man in the torment of his malice, if they can be ſo happie as once to prepare themſelues for Death in a holy meditation, into what amazement will they be brought to conſider of their wondrous folly in their dangerous eſtate? Then pride will ſtrike her ſailes, couetouſnes will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, voluptuoſneſſe more continent, and enuie more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, <note place="margin">Gen. 18.27. Iob. 42.6.</note> it will make vs ſay with <hi>Abraham, I am but duſt and aſhes;</hi> and with the holy man <hi>Iob,</hi> to abhor our ſelues, and to repent in duſt and aſhes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond dutie in this generall preparation, is that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man muſt daily indeauor to take away from his owne Death the power and ſting thereof. <note place="margin">Iudg. 16.5.</note> The Philiſtimes ſaw by
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1365:51"/> experience that <hi>Samſon</hi> was of great ſtrength, and therefore they vſed meanes to know in what part of his body his ſtrength lay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In like manner the time will come, when we muſt incounter hand to hand, and grapple with cruell death; and therefore the beſt way is before hand, while we haue a breathing time to learne where the ſting of Death (which is his ſtrength) doth ly, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once knowne, we muſt with all ſpeed cut off his <hi>Samſons</hi> locks, bereaue him of his power, diſarme him, and make him weake and vnable to deſtroy vs.</p>
               <p>Now to finde out the way, we neede not vſe the counſell of any <hi>Dalilah,</hi> but we haue the oracles and counſels of God, which direct vs plainely, wherein the ſtrength and ſting of Death conſiſts, namely in our ſinnes, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſting of Death</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is ſinne.</hi> And ſeeing we now know that the power and force of euery mans death doth lye in his owne ſinnes, (the wages whereof is death, as the ſame Apoſtle telleth vs) and the body is to dy becauſe of ſinne, <note place="margin">Rom. 6 23. Rom. 8.10.</note> wee muſt therefore indeauour before Death come vpon vs, to pull out this ſting, and take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him his power &amp; ſtrength by humbling our ſelues in the time preſent for all our ſinnes paſt, and by turning our ſelues to God for the time to come; and to labour to haue our ſinnes pardoned and forgiuen by the pretious death and blood-ſhedding of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; by which meanes, and none other, the power of Death is much rebated. For Chriſt dyed not to take away Death (as yet) but to change Death, not to overthrow the being of death, but to plucke out the ſting of Death, not quite to ſtop vp the graue, but to remoue and quell the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie of the graue. By which meanes Death cannot now ſting them that haue their ſinnes forgiuen, nor the graue tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer them.</p>
               <p>Death in it ſelfe is the way to hell vnto the wicked, but it is altered and changed vnto the children of God by grace,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1365:52"/> and is become vnto them a portall, by which the ſoule paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of the fraile body into heauen. In it ſelfe Death is as a Sergeant to arreſt men, and bring them to iudgment, but to the elect children of God, by the Death of Chriſt, it is as the Angell which guided the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> and ſets them at liberty, and leads them from the vale of teares into the land of righteouſnes; and by this meanes of a mighty and bloudie enemie, is ſo far forth made tractable and friendly, that wee may now with comfort encounter with Death, and preuaile, ſeeing now it is become a peece of our happines.</p>

This therefore is a dutie which you muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to doe euery day.</p>

But this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration will bring thee to liue the life of the righteous, and then no doubt but thou ſhalt alſo dye the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
               <p>The third dutie in our generall preparation, is in this life to enter into the firſt degree of life eternall; for eternall life and happines hath three degrees, one in this life, and that is when a man can truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I liue, and yet not I, but Chriſt liueth in me, and the life which I now liue in the fleſh, I liue by faith in the ſonne of God, who loued me, and gaue himſelfe for me;</hi> and this all ſuch can ſay as doe vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and beleeue, and that are iuſtified from their ſinnes, ſanctified againſt their ſinnes, and haue the peace of a good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1365:52"/> conſcience, with other good gifts and graces of the holie Spirit, being the earneſt peny of their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is in the end of this life, that is, when the bodie goes to the earth, from whence it came, and the ſoule returnes to God that gaue it, and is carried by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the end of the world, that is, at the reſurrection and laſt iudgement, when bodie and ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reunited together, who were ancient louing familiers, liuing and ſuffering together, and from their firſt conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did draw together as ſweete yoke-fellowes in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, doe now ioyntly enter together into the Kingdome of glory. So that the firſt of theſe three degrees is in this life into which we muſt enter. For he that will liue in eternal happineſſe, muſt firſt begin in this life to riſe out of the graue of ſinne, in which by nature he lyes buried, and then liue in newneſſe of life by grace.</p>
               <p>The fourth dutie in our generall preparation, is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and inure our ſelues in dying by little and little, before we come to that point that we muſt needs die indeed. For he that leaues this world, before the world leaue him, giues Death the hand like a welcome meſſenger, and departs in peace. Wherefore as they in open games of actiuitie, as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhooting, wreſtling and ſuch like, long before hand, breath their bodies, and exerciſe themſelues, that in the day of triall they may winne the game, &amp;c. Euen ſo ſhould wee beginne to die now while we are liuing, that we may be the better prepared for it when it ſhall come indeed.</p>
               <p>But ſome may heere obiect &amp; ſay, how can this be done? The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth anſwere it in giuing vs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by his owne example, when he ſaith, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.31.</note> 
                  <hi>By our reioycing which wee haue in Christ Ieſus our Lord, I die daily.</hi> And doutleſſe this Apoſtle died daily, not only becauſe he was often in danger of death by reaſon of his calling, but alſo becauſe in all his dangers and troubles hee inured himſelfe to die. For when men doe make the right vſe of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1365:53"/> and doe with their might endeauour to beare them patiently, humbling themſelues, as vnder the Lords cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement and correction, then they are ſaid to begin to die well. And he that would mortifie his greateſt ſinnes, muſt firſt begin to doe it in his ſmalleſt ſinnes; which being once reformed, he ſhall with more eaſe be able to ouercome his maſter ſinnes. For this is the way to keepe ſinne from raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our mortall bodies. So likewiſe he that would bee able to beare the croſſe of all croſſes, as namely death, which is the end of all croſſes, muſt firſt of all learne to beare ſmall croſſes, as ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, troubles, loſſes, pouertie and the like, which may fitly be tearmed little deathes, and the beginnings of the greater death; with which little deaths we muſt firſt acquaint our ſelues, before wee can be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with great Death. For as one well ſaith, <hi>Death after the croſſe is the leſſe.</hi>

               <p>The world is ſet vnto vs as a houſe, wherein we are but tenants at will; out of which the Lord by ſickneſſe and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes giueth vs warning, and by death determineth his will, and requireth it againe at our hands, and willeth vs thereby to prepare our ſelues for a better houſe; and the new houſe for which we are to prepare our ſelues is moſt pleaſant, and not ſo fraile, ruinous and weake, as our worldly houſe; for the tiles doe ſometimes fall off this houſe, the walles doe reele, the roofe doth drop, the pillars doe leane, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ſinke; And what are theſe, but ſo many warnings of the Lord to vs to depart hence, and prepare for a better place? Therfore when thou doſt perceiue thy falling haires, thy watering eyes, thy trembling hands, thy weake knees, and thy ſtooping bodie; what are theſe, but onely the citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Death, which ſeemes to warne thee to prepare to packe vp, that thou maiſt with more eaſe be able to goe out of this ruinous houſe of thine.</p>
               <p>It is a fable, but it hath a good mortall: A certaine man did couenant with Death that he ſhould neuer ſurprize him at vnawares or ſodainly, before that he had firſt ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1365:53"/> to him to giue him warning that ſhortly hee would arreſt him; to which Death aſſented, that though he could not alwaies forbeare him, yet before hee did ſtrike him, hee would giue him warning. Vpon Deaths promiſe thus paſt, this man liued ſecure, ſpending his time in all maner of riot and exceſſe; and when he thoughtfull little of Death, then came Death to take him away; with whom this man expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulating for breach of promiſe: Death in diſcharging of his fidelitie, replied, that with none, no not thoſe that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all promiſes, had he broken promiſe, for (ſaith he) I haue ſent many meſſenger vnto you, from time to time, to giue you warning of my comming; thou waſt ſixe yeares ſince taken with a grieuous Feuer; within theſe two yeeres ſore troubled with Rhumes and diſtillations; ſince that, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the cough and paine in the head, &amp; then troubled with the conſumption of the Lungs: And did I not lately ſend my brother Germaine vnto thee, the drouſie ſleeping diſeaſe <hi>veturnoſum ſoporem,</hi> in which thou didſt lye for a while like a dead man? All theſe were fore-runners of my comming, to warne thee to make thy ſelfe ready for mee, who was neere at hand. Is there any amongſt vs, that is not ſometimes admoniſhed of Deathes approaching by ſome of theſe his Apparators, that hee muſt ſhortly depart? The Poet ſaith truely:
<q>
                     <l>Mille modis lethi miſeros mors vna fatigat.</l>
                  </q>
                  <q>
                     <l>A thouſand kinds, yet but one death,</l>
                     <l>Hath death, to take away our breath.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence let all men learne, that haue care of their ſaluation, what they ought to doe, and be warie to prepare themſelues for Death, before Death doth end their life. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten we ought to prepare for Death, and doe not, at laſt wee die indeed; and would then and cannot.</p>
               <p>Therefore while our feete are at liberty, and before we be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1365:54"/> bound hand and foote, let vs runne the way of the Lords Commandements, and while we haue tongues, and before we become ſpeechleſſe, let vs vſe our tongues well, and not ſuffer them to ſinne. <note place="margin">Mat. 22.12.13.</note> And while we haue hands and armes, and before our armes not from our ſhoulders, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.28.</note> let vs worke with our hands the things that are good, and procure things honeſt in the ſight of all men; <note place="margin">Pſal. 150.6.</note> and while wee haue breath, before God ſtop our breath, let vs praiſe the Lord. And while we haue eares, <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.4:</note> before theſe daughters of ſinging bee abaſed, let vs lift vp our eares to heare the word of God, and not to vanitie.</p>

                  <hi>All we therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>haue opportunitie, to doe good vnto all men, eſpecially to them that are of the houſhold of faith.</hi> All this is a good preparation for death, and by our patience in ſuffering afflictions, it will make Death when it comes, the eaſier for vs, and the leſſe able to afflict vs. For he that dyeth (ſaith one) before hee die, ſhall not dye when he doth die.</p>
               <p>In a temporall building the ſtones muſt be broken, cut, hewen, and ſquared, ere they be fit to make vp the worke. The corne muſt bee cut downe, bound vp, carried into the barne, threſhed, winnowed, clenſed and grinded, before it be ready for good bread. And the whirlewinde muſt firſt blow, <note place="margin">2. King. 2.11.</note> before <hi>Eliah</hi> be rapt vp into heauen. And wee muſt be cut, hewen and ſquared with a number of Deathes meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers before wee can bee made fit for the Lords building. We muſt be toſſed with the winde and weather, before wee can arriue in the hauen of heauen. The very victualls which wee eate, muſt firſt from life be brought to the fire, and bee cleane altered in loſing their propertie, from the fire to the table, from the table to the mouth, ſo to the ſtomacke, and there be concocted and diſgeſted, before they can nouriſh and worke their perfection in vs. Euen ſo Gods children muſt be mangled and defaced in this world, which is the mill to grinde vs the kitchin to receiue vs, and the fire to boyle, roaſt and bake vs, to alter the propertie from that wee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1365:54"/> were at the firſt, that we thereby may bee made fitte to be brought to the Lords table. For as raw fleſh is wholeſome meate for men, ſo vnmortified men bee no creatures fit for God.</p>
               <p>By all which meanes the Lord brings vs to mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which be the little Deathes, that thereby we may be the better armed and prepared for the great death, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to endure the ſame with more eaſe. For wee muſt learne to giue intertainment, to the Herbengers, ſeruants, and meſſengers of Death, that we may the better intertaine the Lord and Maſter when he commeth.</p>
               <p>This point, that bleſſed martyr, Saint <hi>Bylney,</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, who oftentimes before his burning and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did put his finger into the flame of a candle, not only to make triall of his abilitie in ſuffering, but alſo to arme, ſtrengthen, and prepare himſelfe againſt greater torments and paines in his death, which hee did ſuffer with the more eaſe. And thus you ſee the fourth dutie which we muſt in any wiſe learne and remember, becauſe otherwiſe wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo well able to beare and endure the pangs of death well, except we be firſt well ſchooled, nurtured, and trained vp by inuring our ſelues to die through the ſundrie afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trials of this life.</p>
               <p>The fift and laſt duety of our generall preparation is ſet downe vnto vs by the Preacher, who ſaith, <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>All that thine hand ſhall finde to doe, doe it with all thy power.</hi> And marke the reaſon, <hi>For there is neither worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome in the graue, whither thou goeſt.</hi> Therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be able to doe any good ſeruice or office, either to the Church of God or Common-wealth, or to any publike or priuate perſon, let him doe it with all ſpeed, and with all his might, leſt by Death he bee preuented. He that hath care thus to ſpend his dayes, ſhall with much comfort and peace of conſcience end his dayes. Thus much of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preparation for death.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the perticular preparation for Death, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1365:55"/> this is in the time of ſickneſſe; and in the right and true manner of making this particuler preparation, are contained three ſorts of duties: one concerning God, another mans ſelfe, and the third, our neighbour.</p>
               <p>The firſt concerning God is to ſeek to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, though wee haue bin long ſince aſſured of his fauour: all other duties muſt come after in the ſecond place, and they are of no value or effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this.</p>
               <p>Touching the duties which hee is to performe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they are two-fold, the one concerning his ſoule, the other his body.</p>
               <p>The dutie concerning his ſoule, is, that he muſt arme and furniſh himſelfe againſt the immoderate feare of preſent death, and the reaſon hereof is very plaine, becauſe how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer naturally men feare Death through the whole courſe of their liues more or leſſe, yet in time of ſickneſſe, when death approacheth, this naturall feare bred in the bone, will moſt of all ſhew it ſelfe euen in ſuch ſort, as it will aſtoniſh the ſences of the ſicke partie. And therefore it is neceſſarie that we ſhould vſe ſome meanes to ſtrengthen our ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the feare of Death: which meanes are of two ſorts, Practiſe and Meditation. Practiſe, that the ſicke man muſt not ſo much regard Death it ſelfe, as the benefits of God whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h are obtained after death. He muſt not fixe his minde vpon the conſideration of the pangs and torments of death, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l his thoughts and affections muſt bee vpon that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate that he is to enioy after death. He that is to ſwim ouer ſome great and deepe Riuer, muſt not looke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the violent running of the ſtreame, but if he would pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uent feare, hee muſt caſt his eyes to the bancke on the further ſide, to the which place he is to paſſe: and euen ſo, he that drawes neere vnto death, muſt looke, as it were ouer the waues of death, and directly fixe the eyes of his faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eternall life and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>The meditations which ſerue for this purpoſe are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1365:55"/> three: the firſt is borrowed from the ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, namely that the Death of euery man, much more of euery child of God is not onely foreſeene, but alſo appoynted by God. Yea the death of euery man deſerued and procured by his owne ſinnes, is laid vpon him by God, who in this reſpect may bee ſaid to be the cauſe of euery mans death. <note place="margin">Acts 4.28.</note> The Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> confeſſed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came to paſſe in the Death of Chriſt, but that which the foreknowledge and eternall counſell of God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore alſo the Death of euery member of Chriſt is foreſeene and foreordained by the ſpeciall decree and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. I adde further that the very circumſtances of Death, as the time, place, and manner, the beginning of the ſickneſſe, the continuance, the end of it, euery fit in the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the pangs of Death are ſet downe particularly in the counſell of God. For vnto the Lord (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) belong the iſſues of Death. <note place="margin">Pſal. 68.20.</note> The carefull conſideration of this one point will bee a notable meanes to arme vs againſt all feare, diſtruſt and impatience in the time of ſicknes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of our Death.</p>
               <p>The ſecond meditation is to be borrowed from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promiſe that God hath made to the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which is this, <hi>Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours and their workes follow them;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reue. 14.13.</note> this the Author of truth that can not lye, hath ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Now then let a man but throughly conſider this, that Death ioyned and accompanied with a reformed life hath a promiſe of bleſſednes adioyned with it, and it alone will be a ſufficient meanes to ſtay the rage of our affections, and all immoderate feare of Death.</p>
               <p>The third meditation, is that God hath promiſed his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, bleſſed and comfortable preſence to his ſeruants in their ſicknes, and at their death. And the Lord doth manifeſt his preſence three wayes. The firſt is by moderating and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the paines and torments of ſicknes and Death; and hence it comes to paſſe, that to many men the ſorrowes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1365:56"/> and pangs of ſicknes and death are nothing ſo greiuous and troubleſome, as the croſſes and afflictions which they ſuffer in the courſe of their liues. The ſecond way of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is by an inward and vnſpeakeable comfort of his holy ſpirit (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>We reioyce in tribulation;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.4.</note> but why is this reioycing? <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the loue of God is ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>which is giuen vnto vs.</hi> Againe this Apoſtle hauing in grieuous ſickneſſe receiued the ſentence of Death, ſaith of himſelfe, that as the ſufferings of Chriſt did abound in him, ſo his conſolation did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound through Chriſt. Here then we doe ſee, that when earthlie comforts doe faile, the Lord himſelfe drawes neere vnto the bed of the ſicke, and (as it were) doth viſit them in his owne perſon, and miniſtreth vnto them from aboue refreſhing for their ſoules, with his right hand hee holds vp their heads, <note place="margin">Can. 2.6.</note> and with his left hand hee imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them; <note place="margin">Pſal. 41.3.</note> yea <hi>the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>will ſtrengthen them vpon the bed of languiſhing, and he will make all their beds in their ſickneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third meanes of Gods preſence, is the miniſterie of his good Angells, whom he hath appointed as keepers and nurſes for his ſeruants, <note place="margin">Pſal. 91.11 12.</note> to hold them vp and to beare them in their armes as nurſes doe their young infants and babes, and to be as a ſtrong guard vnto them againſt the diuell and his wicked Angels. And all this is obſerued eſpecially in the time of ſicknes; at which time the holy Angells are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent with the children of God to ſuccor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they are ready a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſo to receiue their ſoules at their laſt gaſpe, and carry them into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. <note place="margin">Luk. 16.22</note> And thus much of the firſt dutie of a ſicke man, and the meanes to arme him againſt the feare of Death. Now followeth the ſecond dutie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the body, and that is, that all ſick perſons muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to preſerue health and life, till God doe wholy take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Therefore we muſt referre our life and our death to the goodwill and pleaſure of the Lord. And touching this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life it is a pretious iewell, and as the common ſaying
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1365:56"/> is, life is very ſweete, being giuen to man to this end, that he might haue ſome ſpace of time, wherein he might prepare himſelfe for his happie end, and vſe all good meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto eternall life.</p>
               <p>In the preſeruation of life two things muſt be conſidered the meanes, and the right vſe of the meanes. The meanes, is good and wholeſome phyſick, which muſt be eſteemed as an ordinance and bleſſing of God We read that King <hi>Aſa</hi> is blamed for ſeeking to the Phyſitians in the extremitie of his ſicknes. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 16.12.</note> Whereupon a queſtion may riſe whether it be lawfull (when neceſſitie of ſicknes conſtraineth) to fly to the remedies of Phyſick whereunto the anſwere is eaſie. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> is not here blamed for ſeeking the ordinary meanes of phyſick, but becauſe he ſought not the Lord in his diſeaſe, but onely to the Phyſitians. <note place="margin">Iam 5.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Is any ſicke amongſt you</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) <hi>let him call for the elders of the Chu ch, and let them pray ouer him,</hi> and that is in the very firſt place bfore all other helpe be ſought Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re the diuine ends, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian muſt begin, and it is a very prepoſterous courſe, that the Diuine ſhould there begin where the Phyſitian makes an end; for vntill helpe be had for the ſoule, and ſinne which is the roote of ſickneſſe, be cured. Phyſick for the body is nothing worth: therefore it is a thing much to be miſliked that in all places almoſt the Phyſitian is firſt ſent for, and comes in the beginning of the ſicknes, &amp; the Miniſter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es when a man is halfe dead, and is then ſent for oftentimes, when the ſick partie lyes drawing on and gaſping for breath; as though Miniſters of the Goſpell in theſe dayes were able to worke miracles. The art of Phyſick therefore, nor the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian is here diſallowed, but ouer much confidence in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and in the Phyſitian, without relying vpon God the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Phyſitian; without whoſe bleſſing no Phyſick nor potion can be auaileable to the curing of any maladie or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; neither can the Phyſitian any wayes profit the ſick and diſeaſed patient, except the Lord in mercy giueth a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full working and operation to the medicine againſt the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1365:57"/> diſeaſe, to predominate ouer it for the curing of the ſame.</p>
               <p>The doctrine then from hence is, that the helps of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick are not to be deſpiſed, not too much to be depended on; but our chiefeſt hope is to bee fixed vpon God, who as hee onely puts the ſoule into the body, ſo he onely can take it away againe when it pleaſeth him. Yea theſe ordinary meanes which God hath appoynted, are not to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or neglected, leſt we ſeeme thereby to tempt God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in dangerous diſeaſes. <note place="margin">Eccle. 38.1.2.3.4.56.78.9.12.13.14.</note> Hereof Ieſus the ſon of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith, <hi>Honor a Phyſitian with the honor due vnto him, for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which you may haue of him, for the Lord created him; for of the moſt high commeth healing, and he ſhall receiue honor of the King; the skill of the Phyſitian ſhall lift vp his head, and in the ſight of great men he ſhall be in admiration.

               <p>Now touching the manner of vſing the means, theſe rules muſt be followed. Firſt of all, he that is to take phyſick, muſt not onely prepare his bodie, as Phyſitians doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly preſcribe, but he muſt alſo prepare his ſoule by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelfe vnder the mercifull hand of God in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for his ſinnes; and making earneſt prayers vnto him for pardon, before any medicine come in his body.</p>
               <p>The ſecond rule is, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.5.</note> that when wee haue prepared our ſelues, and are about to vſe the phyſick, we muſt ſanctifie it as wee doe our meate and drinke, by the word of God and prayer.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1365:58"/> man, yet may it eaſily be ſhortened by intemperance in dyet, by gluttony, by drunkenneſſe, by violent diſeaſes, and ſuch like. But care muſt be had to auoide all theſe euils, and the like, that the little lampe of corporall life may burne, till it goe out of it ſelfe by Gods appoyntment, and vntill God hath fulfilled the number of our dayes. <note place="margin">Exod. 23.26.</note> And this very ſpace of time is the day of grace and ſaluation. And whereas God in his iuſtice might haue cut vs off, and vtterly deſtroyed vs long before this day, yet in his great mercie he doth giue vs thus much time, that we might prepare our ſelues for our end. Which time when it is once ſpent, (which may be nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then we are aware) if a man would redeeme it with the price of ten thouſand worlds, <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be obtained. <hi>For what is a man profited</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>if he ſhall gaine the whole world, and loſe his ſoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hauing thus ſeene what bee the duties of the ſicke man to himſelfe: now let vs ſee what be the duties which he oweth to his neighbour. And they are two: Firſt, the dutie of reconciliation, whereby hee is freely to forgiue all men, and to deſire to bee forgiuen by all. In the old Teſtament when a man was to offer a Bullocke or a Lambe in ſacrifice to God, <note place="margin">Matth. 5.23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>He muſt leaue his offering at the Altar, and firſt goe and be reconciled to his brother, if he had ought againſt him, and then come and offer his gift;</hi> much more then muſt this bee done, when wee are dying, to offer vp our ſelues, ſoules and bodies, as an acceptable and reaſonable ſeruice and ſacrifice to God, in forgiuing of all men. And if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee abſent, or will not bee reconciled, yet the ſicke partie by forgiuing, hath diſcharged his owne conſcience, and God will accept his will for the deede in ſuch a caſe. <hi>For if yee forgiue men their treſpaſſes</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father will alſo forgiue you;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>but if yee forgiue not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgiue you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond dutie is, that thoſe which are Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of others muſt haue great care that they which be committed to their charge and gouernment, may be left in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1365:58"/> good eſtate after their death; wherein are three duties to be handled, the firſt of the Magiſtrate, the ſecond of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpell, and the third of the Maſter or Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the family.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrates dutie before his death, is to prouide as farre forth as he can, for the godly and peaceable ſtate and gouernment of all ſuch as are vnder his charge and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that is done partly by procuring the maintenance of pietie, godlineſſe, and ſound religion, and partly by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of good and wholeſome lawes for their ſafetie, peace, and quietneſſe. Whereof there are examples of the practiſe of theſe duties in Gods word. <note place="margin">Deut. 31.1.</note> When <hi>Moſes</hi> was an hundred and twentie yeeres old, and was not longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to goe in and out before the people, he called them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſignified that the time of his departure was at hand, and therefore he tooke order for their welfare after his death. And firſt of all hee placed <hi>Ioſua</hi> ouer them, in his ſtead, to be their guide to the promiſed Land. Secondly, he gaue ſpeciall charge to all the people, to be valiant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious againſt all their enemies, and to obey the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of their God. And <hi>Ioſhua</hi> followes the ſame courſe, <note place="margin">Ioſhua 24.1,</note> for he called the people together, and telles them that the time of his death is at hand, and giues them a charge to bee couragious, and to worſhippe the true God; which being done, he ends his dayes as a worthy Captaine of the Lord. And ſo when King <hi>Dauid</hi> was to go the way of all fleſh, <note place="margin">2. King. 1.1.</note> and lay ſicke on his death-bed, he placed his owne ſonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> vpon his throne, and gaue him charge, both for the maintenance of true religion, and for the execution of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Touching the dutie of Miniſters of the Goſpell, when they are going out of the world, they muſt caſt about and prouide, as much as in them lies, that the Church of God, ouer which God hath made them ouerſeers, may flouriſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are gone. An example whereof we haue in Saint <hi>Paul, Take heede therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vnto your ſelues,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.29.30.31.</note> 
                  <hi>and to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1365:59"/> all the flocke ouer which the holy Ghoſt hath made you ouerſeers, to feed the Church of God, which hee hath purchaſed with his owne bloud. For I know this, that after my departure ſhall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous wolues enter in amongst you, not ſparing the flocke. Alſo of your owne ſelues ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking peruerſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. Therefore watch, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by the ſpace of three yeeres, I ceaſed not to warne euery one night and day with teares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this dutie had been well obſerued and performed, there could not haue beene ſuch abundance of errors and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in the Church of God, as hath beene and are at this day. But becauſe men haue had more care to maintaine perſonall ſucceſſion, then the right ſucceſſion, which ſtands and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the wholeſome word and doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, therefore Wolues, and vnprofitable teachers haue come into the places and roomes of faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paſtors and teachers, not ſparing the flocke of Chriſt, but haue made hauocke of the ſame; the Apoſtacie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath ouerſpread the face of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, houſholders and maſters of families, muſt haue great care to ſet their houſhold and family in good order before they die. Which dutie the Lord himſelfe, by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay,</hi> doth command that good King <hi>Ezechiah</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die and not liue.</hi> And for the procuring good order in the family after death, two things are to be done. The firſt concerning this life, and that is touching the ordering and diſpoſing of lands and goods. And that this may bee well and wiſely done, if the laſt will and teſtament be vnmade in the time of our health, (which is a great fault) it is with godly aduice and counſell to be then made in the time of ſickneſſe, according to the practiſe of ancient and worthy men. <note place="margin">Gen. 25.5.6. Gen. 27. Gen. 49.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> before his death makes his will, and giues Legacies; ſo did <hi>Iſaak</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> in whoſe laſt will and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are contained many worthy and notable leſſons, bleſſings and prophecies of the eſtate of his children. And
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1365:59"/> our Sauiour Chriſt, <note place="margin">Ioh 19.25.</note> when he was vpon the Croſſe prouided for his Mother, eſpecially in remembring her vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> his welbeloued Diſciple. And indeed, this dutie of making a Will, is a matter of great conſequence, for it cuts off much hatred and contention in families, and it preuents many troubles and ſuites in Law. It is not therefore alwaies a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifferencie, which may or may not be done, as many falſely imagine, who vpon blinde and ſiniſter reſpects ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from making their laſt Wills. Some, becauſe they feare they ſhall die the ſooner, and others for ſuch like carnall re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpects; but all ſuch are greatly deceiued; For by diſpoſing thy worldly goods in thy will and teſtament, thou ſhalt not thereby die the more quickly, but the more quietly, and ſhalt thereby preuent the jarres and brawles, that otherwiſe when thou art gone, may ariſe amongſt thy children, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and friends. And herein remember that thou parteſt from earthly poſſeſſions, and art going to take poſſeſſion of heauenly. And in the beſtowing of their poſſeſſions and goods, it muſt be principally vpon their wines and children. <hi>This man</hi> (ſaith God vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15.4.</note> of <hi>Eleazar</hi> a ſtranger) <hi>ſhall not bee thine heire, but the ſonne which ſhall come forth of thine owne bowels, ſhall be thine heire.</hi> Therefore it is vtterly a fault in any man, to alienate his lands or goods, wholly and finally from his bloud and poſteritie; it is a thing which the very law of Nature it ſelfe hath condemned. Againe it is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly a fault to giue all to the eldeſt, and little or nothing in reſpect to the reſt, as though the eldeſt were borne to be the gentleman onely, and the yonger brethren borne to beare the wallet. Yet in equity the eldeſt is to haue more then any of the reſt, <note place="margin">Deu. 21.17.</note> becauſe vnto him there belongeth by the law of God, a double portion, and becauſe Stockes and families in their perſons are to bee preſerued and maintained; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo there muſt alwayes bee ſome that muſt bee fitted thereby, to doe ſome ſpeciall ſeruice for the good both of Church and Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, in the will there muſt bee prouiſion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1365:60"/> made for the godly preaching Miniſter, and poore of the place, and for others well deſeruing the ſame, according to euery mans abilitie, <note place="margin">Num. 27.1. Num. 36.1.</note> and eſpecially for want of children, the next of kinne muſt be remembred in their ſtead.</p>
               <p>The ſecond dutie of the gouernour and maſter of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, concerneth the good of the ſoules of all thoſe that are vnder their charge and gouernment. And this conſiſteth in teaching and inſtructing of them in the feare of the Lord, and to giue them charge that they may perſeuere and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the ſame, after the example of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom the Lord himſelfe commendeth to his euerlaſting praiſe and commendation, for the performing of this duty, as appeareth in the booke of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> 
                  <hi>For I know him</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>that he will command his children and his houſhold after him, that they ſhall keepe the way of the Lord, to doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and iudgement, that the Lord may bring vpon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi> And after the example like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. King. 2.1.2.3.4.</note> who gaue his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> on his death-bed a moſt excellent and ſolemne charge. And this dutie is alſo commended vnto vs in the ſecond booke of <hi>Eſdras,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Eſdr. 14.13.14.15.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>Now therefore ſet thy houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus if maſters and gouernours of families ſhall ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſpoſe of their eſtate, and giue ſuch a godly charge to them whom they ſhall leaue behinde them, then they ſhall hereby greatly honor God dying, as well as liuing. <hi>O that they were wiſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <note place="margin">Deut. 32.29.</note> 
                  <hi>that they vnderſtood this, that they would conſider, and prudently prouide for their latter end.</hi> Wherin foure things are comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto vs, to wit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vnderſtanding, wiſdome and prouidence: whereby it is apparant that God would haue vs to know, vnderſtand and wiſely prouide for our end.

               <p>Likewiſe God wiſheth vs well to vnderſtand, what? Our

They are then eternall riches, and we ſhall be eternall by them; and though Death diſſolue body and ſoule, and deſtroy our preſent being in this life, yet as <hi>Iuſtine Martir</hi> ſpake for himſelfe and others to their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, you may kill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Death is compared to the <hi>Baſiliske,</hi> which if ſhee ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee be ſeene, is dangerous, but if a man firſt deſcrie the <hi>Baſiliske,</hi> the Serpent dieth, and then there is no feare. So if Death be not ſeene, and prouided for before-hand, there is great danger; but if it be ſeene and prouided for, the danger is paſt before their death come. And they who with the glorified Virgins wait for Chriſt in the life of the righteous, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.</note> are alwaies prepared for Death, when it knocketh, to open vnto it; and what is a prepared death, but a happie death? and what followes a happie death, but a happie life, neuer to die againe? Such go in with Chriſt to his mariage, and haue euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Let vs not therefore forget heauen for earth, the ſoule for the bodie, and heauenly ioyes for earthly toyes, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or day, for one houre or minute; let vs not depriue our ſelues of that euerlaſting happineſſe, that ſhall neuer bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from vs, if we prepare our ſelues for it.</p>

As <hi>Daniel</hi> ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and found out by the bookes of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> not only the returne, but the time of the returne of Iſrael to their owne land from their captiuitie.

               <p>Man ſhould be wiſe to vnderſtand and know the reaſons of the certainty of this day of Iudgement &amp; they are theſe. Firſt it is the will and decree of God. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>And the times of this ignorance God winked at,</hi>

                  <hi>His counſell</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) <hi>ſhall ſtand, and he will doe all his pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is an article of our faith grounded on the word of God, <hi>and from thence</hi> (ſaith the Article) <hi>he ſhall come to iudge both the quicke and the dead.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.14.</note> Thirdly, the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>God ſhall bring euery work vnto iudgement, with euery ſecret thing, whether it be good or euill.</hi> But all this is not done heere, for heere many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are cloaked, and carried in a miſt, that deſerue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and merit condemnation. Therefore, that God may be iuſt in his ſayings, there muſt be a ſeſſions of gaole-deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, which the Scriptures cal the iudgement of the laſt day.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the godly doe heere groane vnder many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp; the vngodly wallow in many delights and pleaſures. The rich liue delicately, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> is in paine; therefore it is neceſſary (as it is certaine) that a day ſhould come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord may make knowne his righteouſneſſe, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his iuſtice before his moſt glorious throne; that they who haue liued merily and diſhonored God, might liue in torments of fire; and they whoſe life hath beene miſerable, ſeruing the Lord, might be comforted for euer.

                  <hi>will recompence tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1365:64"/> to all that haue troubled the righteous, and reſt to them that were troubled.</hi> On the otherſide, would it not bee hard for the godly, who haue here endured the croſſe, for the ioy that was ſet before them, if there ſhould not come a time of refreſhing from God. And would it not too much obdurate the wicked (who drinke iniquitie as water) if they ſhould eſcape all puniſhments and vengeance here, and alſo after death?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this is ſhadowed out in that Houſholder, <note place="margin">Mat. 20.8.10. Matth. 25.19.</note> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euening was come, called the labourers, and gaue euery man his hire, and peny.</p>
               <p>And if a wiſe maſter will recken with his ſeruants, ſhal we thinke that Wiſedome it ſelfe will not one day recken with impeniten ſinners, and call them before him for his money, that is, pretious graces of wit, learning, authority, wealth, and other outward and inward ornaments of life, which they haue conſumed on their luſts.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, euery mans conſcience doth by a trembling feare (as in <hi>Felix</hi>) at one time or another, <note place="margin">Acts 24.26.</note> iuſtifie this point of a iudgement to come. And therefore as the Floud of waters once drowned the world, <note place="margin">Gen. 7.1.7.</note> except a few who were ſau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In the euening of the world, and when there ſhall be no more time, he wil cal the labourers before him, giuing them the peny or pay of euerlaſting life; but for the idle and loyterers, he will put them out of the vineyard, <note place="margin">Matth. 7.23.</note> and out of Chriſt, and ſend them with ſinners to the place prepared for them: as they haue liued without the Church, or idle in it, ſo when the labourers receiue their peny, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus it is proued not onely to be certaine, but neceſſarie that there ſhould bee a iudgement, which we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, know, and wiſely prouide for.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1365:65"/>
               <p>But ſome will ſay, ſeeing men come to their account at their death, what needeth any other day of <hi>audit</hi> or hearing; to whom I anſwere, That men at their death receiue but priuate iudgement, but heere they ſhall receiue publike ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then they are iudged in their ſoules onely, heere they ſhall be in ſoule and body. This firſt is but a cloſe ſeſſions, the other is an open and ſolemne aſſiſe. In the firſt, much of their ſhame is hid, heere they ſhalbe aſhamed to the full and vtterly confounded. If our owne lawes doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and execute malefactors in priſon, but in open place and manner for their greater ſhame; it is great reaſon that wicked ſinners ſhould not priuately in the graues, as in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be iudged, and led to execution, but be brought to the publike skaffold and barre of ſolemne ſeſſions, there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their ſhame and ſentence together, and not to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by a cloſe death in the gaole, but be brought forth to ſuffer vpon the high ſtage of the world, in the ſight of Saints and Angels, where all eyes may ſee and behold them.</p>
               <p>And that this day cannot be farre off, it may appeare, both according to the prophecies of holy Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo the truth of the Scriptures. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Maniches,</hi> That the world ſhould laſt ſixe ages, The firſt from <hi>Aadam</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> the ſecond from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the third from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> the fourth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The firſt is to die in, or by faith. And to die by faith, is, when a man in the time of death, doth with all his heart wholly rely himſelfe on Gods eſpeciall loue, fauour &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Chriſt, as it is reuealed in his holy word. And though there be no part of mans life void of iuſt occaſions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may put faith in practiſe, yet the ſpeciall time of all is in the pangs of death, when friends, riches, pleaſures, the outward ſences, temporall life, and all earthly helpes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vs. But put thy truſt, confidence, &amp; faith in God, which neither fadeth nor vaniſheth, <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.8.9.</note> but abideth &amp; continueth for euer. <note place="margin">Pſal. 146.3.4.</note> For if thou bee in amity with God, the night will bee ſhort, and thy ſleepe ſweete, thy graue wil be to thee as a bed of doune, there to reſt till the day of reſurrection; thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at that time wil ſmel as perfume, and thy praiſes ſound in thy ſoule, as the harmonie of the heauens, where thou ſhalt raigne for euer and euer. And then true faith will make vs to goe wholly out of our ſelues, and to deſpaire of comfort and ſaluation in reſpect of any earthly thing, and to reſt and rely wholly with all the power and ſtrength of our heart vpon the pure loue and mercies of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>When the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe were ſtung with fiery Serpents, and lay at the point of death, they looked vp to the braſen Serpent, <note place="margin">Num. 21.8.9.</note> which was erected for that purpoſe by Gods owne appointment, and then were preſently hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; euen ſo, when any man feeles death to approach and draw neere with a fiery ſting to pierce his heart, hee muſt then preſently fixe the eyes of a true and liuely faith vpon Chriſt his Sauiour exalted, lifted vp, <note place="margin">Iohn 3.14.15.</note> and crucified vpon the Croſſe: which being done, he ſhall by death enter into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. It is recorded by the Author to the Hebrewes, <note place="margin">Heb. 11.13.</note> that the holy Fathers of the old Teſtament died in faith, and ſo entred into glory. And if wee will looke to be glorified with them, then muſt we follow their ſteps in dying in the ſame faith with them.

Death is the feare of rich men, the deſire of poore men, but ſurely the end of all men; to this ſtep man commeth as ſlowly as hee can, trembling at this paſſage, and labouring to ſettle himſelfe here; the ſole memory of Death, mournefull fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and the reading of inſcriptions ingrauen on ſepulchers doe make the the very haire to ſtare and ſtand on end, and ſtrike many with an horror and apprehenſion of it; which is a reproofe to thoſe, who can ſee nothing in their owne deaths, but what is dreadfull beyond meaſure, and ſimplie the end of man. Such conceiue Death not as it is to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and as Chriſt hath made him to bee by his glorious death, but as fooles iudge of him, who behold him through
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1365:71"/> falſe ſpectacles as he is in his owne vncorrected nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered out of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Amos 6.3.</note> that is, moſt vgly, terrible, &amp; hideous; ſo did they behold him in <hi>Amos,</hi> who put the euill day of his comming, (that which they call euill, and the godly long for, and iudge happie) as farre from them as they could by carnall delicacie and wantonneſſe. So did <hi>Baltaſhar</hi> looke vpon him, <note place="margin">Dan. 5.5.6.30.</note> whoſe heart would not ſerue him to read the hand writing of his owne end ſo neere. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 25.37.38.</note> And <hi>Nabal</hi> who had no heart to dy, when hee muſt needes dye, dyed like a ſtone, that is, dyed blockiſhly, and ſo faintly that he was as good as ſlaine before Death ſlue him. He had no comfort in Death, beeing churliſh and profane, and no maruell, for this aduerſary Death armed as <hi>Goliah,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.10.11.</note> and vaunting as that proud Giant of <hi>Gath</hi> commeth ſtalking toward ſuch in fearefull manner, inſulting ouer weake duſt, and daring the world to giue him a man to fight withall. Therefore at the ſight of him the whole hoſt of worldlings bewray great feare, turning their faces, and flying backe, as men readie to ſinke into the earth, with abated courages, and deiected countenances, ſtayned with the colours of feare and Death, trembling like leaues in a ſtorme, and ſtriken with the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of a ſodaine and violent ſhaking through all the body. But the true child of God, armed as <hi>Dauid,</hi> with truſt in God, and expectation of victory by the Death of Chriſt, (who by Death ouercame Death, as <hi>Dauid</hi> cut off the head of <hi>Goliah</hi> with his owne ſword) dares, and doth boldly, and obediently incounter with this huge Philiſtime Death (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed inuincible and ſeeming great) but neither with ſword nor ſpeare, but in the name of the God of the hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whoſe might onely he woundeth and ſtriketh him to the earth, trampling vpon him with his feete, and reioycing in the returne of his ſoule to the place from whence it firſt came, he ſingeth this ioyfull and triumphant ſong of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>O Death where is thy ſting &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.55.</note> he hath the eyes of <hi>Stephen</hi> to looke vp into heauen, and therefore in obedience and a willing minde he dyeth.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1365:71"/>
               <p>But a wicked man dying may ſay to Death as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eliah, haſt thou found me, O mine enemie:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 21.20.</note> but when it is told the child of God that Death is come within his dores<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to looke him in the face, he to ſhew his courage and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, may ſay as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith of <hi>Ahymaaz,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.27.</note> let him come and welcome, for he is my friend and a good man, and hee commeth with good tidings; ſo he, Death is my friend, let him come, he is a good man and bringeth good tidings. As for the wicked they doe with <hi>Felix,</hi> tremble, <note place="margin">Acts 24.26.</note> if they doe but heare of death and of iudgment, and are like vnto <hi>Saul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ſtrength in them, but fall into a ſound when they heare of death, and if they could but ſee it, they would caſt a jauelin as <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.11.</note> to ſlay it.</p>
               <p>But the children of God doe willingly welcome Death, as Gods ſeruant and meſſenger, and applaud it as <hi>Iacob</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the Chariots that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his ſonne ſent for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him out of a Countrey of miſery into a land of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Gen. 45.27.48</note> where he ſhould haue food enough, the beſt in the land. So the hope and expectation of the Saints is that they ſhall ſee God, and come to Chriſt by Death preſently in their ſoules, and in their bodies at the laſt day. So they may ſay of Death as <hi>Adoniah</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Ionathan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athar</hi> the Prieſt come in, for thou art a valiant man, <note place="margin">1 Kings 1.42.</note> and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt good tidings.</p>
               <p>Cruell and vnmercifull Death makes a league with no man, <note place="margin">Eſay 28.15.</note> and yet the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth that the wicked man doth make a league with death: how may this be? There is no league made indeede, but onely in the wicked imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, who falſely thinkes that Death will not come neere him, though all the world ſhould be deſtroied. And therefore the ſeperation of the ſoule from the body will be bitter to the wicked, which cannot bee ſeperated without great griefe, woe, and lamentation. As the Oxe doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lowe and mourne, when his yoke-fellow wont to draw with him, is taken away, ſo the wicked then mourne, when the ſoule ſhall be ſeperated from the body; then will
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1365:72"/> the ſoule and the bodie with teares repeat againe and againe, doſt thou thus ſeperate vs bitter Death? <hi>O Death &amp;c.</hi> Then griefes follow griefes, and ſorrow comes vpon ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and then what a wound doth the heart of the wicked receiue which loueth this preſent life? When the Phyſitian ſaith vnto him, thou muſt from henceforth thinke no more on life but of Death; at the hearing of which heauie newes, the body ſhall dye once whether he will or no, but the heart ſhall dye ſo often, as the things and ſinnes be in number which he loued. Then ſhall the moſt cleere light be turned into darkeneſſe, becauſe thoſe things which aforetime were occaſions of great ioy, ſhall now become moſt horrible vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and torment, which will make the wicked ſet their throates vpon tainter hookes, and lift vp their voyces like trumpets, and cry out at that time vpon Death, as the deuils did vpon Chriſt in the Goſpell, ſaying what haue we to doe with thee O cruell Death, <note place="margin">Mat. 8.29. Iob 2.4.</note> art thou come hither to torment vs before the time? And therefore well ſaid the deuill <hi>pellem pro pelle,</hi> skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath will hee giue for his life, ſo that he may enioy that, although but for a moment longer. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> depart from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my people, ſo ſay the vngodly to death bee baniſhed from vs, thy preſence, thy ſhadow &amp; the very remembrance of thee is fearefull to vs, to heare Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeake of Gods terrible iudgment to come is too trembling a doctrine for their delightfull diſpoſitions, to heare with <hi>Felix</hi> they are not at leaſure, for this is iarring muſicke which ſounds not arright in the conſort of their worldly pleaſures, to thinke of death is <hi>Aceldama</hi> (ſaith one) euen a field of blood: but if any Phyſition would take vpon him to make men liue euer in this world what a multitude of patients ſhould he haue? And how well would they reward him?</p>
               <p>But the children of God reioyce at the newes of Death, to ſhew their obedience to it, and their ioy is according to the ioy of harueſt (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) and as men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce when they deuide the ſpoyle. <note place="margin">Iſa. 9.3.</note> And they may ſay of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1365:72"/> Death when it commeth, as the people triumphantly ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſpoke of the day of King <hi>Dauids</hi> coronation, <note place="margin">Pſal. 118.24.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will reioyce and be glad in it.</hi> And they may call Death, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did the place where he came, <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> becauſe there the Angels of God met him, when hee was to meete with his cruell brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32.1.2.</note> euen ſo when the children of God are to meete with cruell Death, the Lord will ſend his holy Angels, <note place="margin">Hebr. 1.14.</note> (who are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heires of ſaluation) to carrie them into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome.</p>
               <p>Tell one of our gallants in his ſickneſſe, that Death is come for him, <note place="margin">2. King. 9.20.</note> and that his driuing is like the driuing of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi> comming furiouſly toward him, he hath the Athenian queſtion preſently ready, <hi>What will this babler ſay?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.18.</note> But this newes comming to the childe of God in his ſickneſſe, hee may be talked withall; for he hath learned with <hi>Samuel</hi> to ſay, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3.10.18</note> and to ſay with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, It is the Lord, let him doe as ſeemeth good to him:</hi> and with <hi>Dauid</hi> to ſay, <hi>Heere am I, let him doe to mee,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.26.</note> 
                  <hi>as ſeemeth good to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of this great difference betwixt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the godly, why they are thus diuerſly affected vnto Death, is this; the wicked enioy their haue-beſt in this life, but the godly looke for their good, and are walking toward it. And if it ſhould be demanded when a wicked man is at his beſt: the anſwere is, the beſt is euill enough, and that his beſt is, when he comes firſt into the world; for then his ſins are feweſt, his iudgements eaſieſt; they goe aſtray as ſoone as they are borne, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <note place="margin">Pſal. 58.3.</note> It had beene good for him therefore, that the knees had not preuented him, but that he had died in the birth; Nay, <hi>it had beene good for him,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iob 3.11.12.</note> (as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Iudas</hi> which betrayed him) <hi>if he had neuer beene borne.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.24.</note> For as a Riuer which is ſmalleſt at the beginning, increaſeth as it proceeds by the acceſſion of other waters into it, till at length it be ſwallowed vp in the deepe. So the wicked, the longer he liueth, he waxeth euer
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1365:73"/> worſe and worſe, <note place="margin">2.

Reuel. 19.20.</note> And this the Apoſtle expreſſeth moſt ſignificantly, when he compares the wicked men to one ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering treaſure, wherein he heapes and treaſureth vp wrath to himſelfe againſt the day of wrath, and the reuelation of the righteous iudgement of God. For euen as the worldling, who euery day caſteth in a peece of money into his treaſure, in few yeeres multiplies ſuch a ſumme, the particulers wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he himſelfe is not able to keepe in minde, but when hee breaks vp his cheſt, then he finds it in ſundry ſorts of coyne, whereof he had no remembrance. Euen ſo, and worſe it is with thee, O impenitent ſinner, who not only euery day, but euery houre and minute of time multiplyeſt thy tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and defileſt thy conſcience, hoording vp one euill work vpon another. To what a reckoning (thinkeſt thou) ſhall thy ſins amount in the end? though thou forgetteſt them, as thou doſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit them; <note place="margin">Rom. 2.5.</note> yet the Apoſtle telleth thee that thou haſt laid them vp in a treaſury, and not only ſo, but that with euery ſinne, thou haſt gathered a portion of wrath propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to thy ſinne, which thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> perfectly know in that day, <note place="margin">Pſal. 50.21.</note> wherein the Lord ſhall breake vp thy treaſure, and open the booke of thy conſcience, and ſet thy ſinnes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before thee.</p>
               <p>But if you wil aske when the children of God are at their beſt, I anſwere, praiſed be God, our worſt is away, our good is begun, <note place="margin">Iohn 7.6.</note> our beſt is at hand. As our Sauiour ſaid to his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo may we ſay to the worldlings, <hi>Your time is alwayes, but my time is not yet come:</hi> the children of God are not at their beſt now, it is in the working, onely wee were at our worſt before our conuerſion; For our whole life till then was a walking with the children of diſobedience, in the broad way that leads to damnation; and then were wee at the worſt when wee had proceeded furtheſt in the way of vnrighteouſneſſe, becauſe then we were furtheſt from God.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1365:73"/> Our beſt, began in the day of our recalling, wherin the Lord by his word and holy Spirit called vpon vs, and made vs turne our backes vpon Satan, and our face toward the Lord, and cauſed vs to part company with the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, amongſt whom wee had our conuerſation before; then we came home with the penitent forlorne, to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers family, but they went forward in their ſins to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That was a day of diuiſion betwixt vs and our ſinnes; in that day with Iſrael we entred into the borders of Canaan into Gilgal, and there we were circumciſed, <note place="margin">Ioſua 5.9.</note> and the ſhame of Egypt was taken from us, euen our ſinne, which is our ſhame indeed, and which we haue borne from our mothers wombe. The Lord grant that wee may keepe it for euer in thankfull remembrance and that we may count it a double ſhame to returne againe to the bondage of Egypt, to ſerue the Prince of darkneſſe in bricke and clay, that is, to haue fellowſhip any more with the vnfruitful workes of darknes, but that like the redeemed of the Lord, <note place="margin">Pſal. 84.7.</note> we may walke from ſtrength to ſtrength, till wee appeare before the face of our God in Sion. For heere wee are not at our beſt, but our beſt is to come Now our life is hid with the Lord, and wee know not yet what we ſhall be; <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.2.</note> but wee know when hee ſhall appeare, we ſhall be like him, the Lord ſhall carry vs by his mercy, and bring vs in his ſtrength to his holy habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; hee ſhall plant vs in the mountaine of his inheritance, <note place="margin">Exod. 15.13.</note> euen the place which he hath prepared, <note place="margin">Iſa. 35.10.</note> and the Sanctuary which he hath eſtabliſhed. Then euerlaſting ioy ſhall be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads, and ſorrow and mourning ſhall fly away from vs for euer.</p>
               <p>Therefore for this cauſe, we muſt firſt indeuour that our death be voluntary; for to die well, is to die willingly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we muſt labour that our ſinnes die before vs. And thirdly, that wee bee alwayes ready and prepared for it. O what an excellent thing it is for a man to end his life before his death, that at the houre of death he hath nothing to doe, but only to be willing to die, that he haue no need of time,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1365:74"/> nor of himſelfe, but ſweetly and obediently to depart this life, ſhewing therby his obedience to the ordinance of God; for wee muſt make as much conſcience in performing our obedience vnto God in ſuffering death, as wee doe in the whole courſe of our liues.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chriſt is a notable example and paterne for vs to follow in this caſe. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let this minde be in you,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.5.6.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>which was alſo in Chriſt Ieſus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God, but made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in faſhion as a man, hee humbled himſelfe and became obedient vnto death, euen vnto the death of the croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although the wicked bee ill affected vnto death, (as we haue alreadie heard) and would (if it lay in their power) moſt villanouſly intreate and handle death, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.4.</note> as <hi>Hamon</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Naaſh</hi> King of the Ammonites, did the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of King <hi>Dauid;</hi> yet let euery good man (when Death ſhall come for him, as it may ſeeme to him vntimely, before the threed of his life be halfe ſpunne out) be heere informed to entertaine it kindly, <note place="margin">Gen. 19.1.</note> as <hi>Lot</hi> did the Angels, who came to fetch him out of Sodom. For though he bee pulled from his ſeate, which was to him, as the plaine of Sodom ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>Lot,</hi> as a pleaſant Paradiſe, yet ſhall hee finde with <hi>Lot,</hi> that hee is taken away from the iudgement to come, howſoeuer he be taken away, either by the malice of wicked men, or by the mercie of God; and that he is ſeparated from the ſinnes of this world, which grieued his ſoule; yea from ſinning himſelfe, and from his owne ſinnes, which grieued the Lord his ſo gratious and kinde Father. How can it be, but that Death ſhould be a welcome gueſt, &amp; this a choice bleſſing, which as a gentle guide leades vs to Chriſt, carrieth the ſoule to her beloued Husband? The reſolution of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> was neither to loath life, nor feare to die, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently yeeld vnto Death, becauſe (ſaith he) we haue a good Lord to goe vnto.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1365:74"/>
               <p>The third duetie is to die in repentance, which muſt bee performed by vs at all times, and eſpecially at this time. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that he is a notorious ſinner, and borne for nothing but repentance; and hee which is borne for repentance, muſt practiſe repentance as long as he liues in this ſinfull world, into which hee is borne vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that hee muſt leaue it againe, and repent at his end alſo.</p>
               <p>Repentance is a very ſore diſpleaſure, which a man hath in his heart for his ſinnes, euen becauſe they are the breach of Gods holy Lawes and Commandements, &amp; an offence to God his moſt mercifull and louing Father, which ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth in him a true hatred againſt ſinne, and a ſetled purpoſe and holy deſire to liue better in time to come, ordering his life and death by the will of God reuealed in his holy word.</p>
               <p>Repentance conſiſteth of foure parts: the firſt of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; by which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Dan. 9.4.</note> 
                  <hi>We acknowledge our owne wickedneſſe, and the wickedneſſe of our fathers, for we haue ſinned againſt thee; righteouſneſſe therefore belongeth vnto thee, but vnto vs ſhame and vtter confuſion. Father</hi> (ſaith the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall childe) <hi>I haue ſinned againſt heauen, and in thy ſight,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 15.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and am no more worthy to be called thy ſonne. He that couereth his ſinnes</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe-man) <hi>ſhall not proſper,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 28.13.</note> 
                  <hi>but who ſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them, ſhall haue mercy.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 1 9.</note> 
                  <hi>If we confeſſe our ſinnes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he is faithfull and iuſt to forgiue vs our ſinnes, and to clenſe vs from all vnrighteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Contrition. <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſacrifices of God</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are a broken ſpirit; and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not diſpiſe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 57.15.</note> 
                  <hi>For thus ſaith the high and loftie one that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth eternitie, whoſe name is holy. I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, to reuiue the ſpirit of the humble, and to reuiue the heart of the contrite ones. For all theſe things hath my hand made,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and all theſe things haue beene</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>but to this man will I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1365:75"/> at my words.</hi> So that this contrition is the bruiſing of a ſinners heart (as it were) to duſt and powder, through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained and deepe griefe conceiued of Gods diſpleaſure for ſinne; and this is Euangelicall contrition, and is a worke of grace, the beginning of renewed repentance. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh repentance vnto ſaluation not to be repented of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is faith. For without faith, neither by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor by any other meanes are we able to pleaſe God, neither indeede can there bee any true repentance without faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt point is amendment. To amend, is to redreſſe and reforme faults; repentance is as the roote, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment the fruit. <note place="margin">Matth. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Bring forth therefore fruit</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>meete for repentance, or anſwerable to amendment of life. Repent</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and turne to God,</hi>

                  <hi>and doe works meet for repentance;</hi> ſo that firſt there muſt be a change of the heart from euill to good, by the gift of repentance put into it of God, and then will follow amendment of our liues and manners.</p>
               <p>There is no part of Chriſtian religion, of that maine importance, wherein men doe more voluntarily deceiue themſelues, then commonly they doe in this dutie of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. In reſpect whereof it will not be amiſſe, but very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall to deliuer, certaine infallible ſignes, and vnſeparable fruits, whereby we may aſſure our ſelues that wee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> nameth ſeuen fruits, which in ſome meaſure alwayes follow, where true amendment go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before. <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your godly ſorrowes, what care</hi> (1) <hi>it hath wrought in you? yea what clearing</hi> (2) <hi>of your ſelues? yea what indignation</hi> (3)? <hi>yea what feare</hi> (4)? <hi>yea how great deſire</hi> (5)? <hi>yea what zeale</hi> (6)? <hi>yea what puniſhment?</hi> Thoſe then who are true conuerts, who do vnfainedly amend their liues they are not ſluggiſh or ſecure in ſinne, but carefull to redreſſe what is amiſſe, not hiders or excuſers of euill,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1365:75"/> but confeſſors, and by humble ſupplication clearing their offences; they are not contented to dwell in wickedneſſe, but vexed in ſoule, and full of indignation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for their ſinnes committed; they ſtand in awe and are afraid of Gods iudgments, they deſire his fauour as the Hart deſireth the water-brookes, <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.1.</note> they labour by religious zeale to approue their liues to God and good men, and they are ſo farre from fauoring their faults, as that they ſeuerely puniſh them vpon themſelues.</p>
               <p>Muſt then amendement of life yeeld ſuch worthy works and fruits? Is care, clearing, indignation, feare, deſire, zeale, and puniſhment required thereunto? O then to repent can bee no light matter, nor trifling labour, which a man may haue at commandement, or performe when he liſteth; no, no, for much toile and trauell belongeth vnto it.</p>
               <p>Sinne cannot bee caſt off as an vpper garment, the hearts of ſinners muſt ſuffer an earth-quake within them, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and rend like the vaile of the Temple, <note place="margin">Mat. 27.51.</note> which was rent in twaine from the top to the bottom, and like the earth which did quake, and like the rocks which rent at the yeelding vp of the hoſt of our Sauiour Chriſt for our ſinnes; ſo that muſt torment vs at the heart, which delighteh vs in our bodies, that muſt bee ſoure to our ſoules, which was ſweete in our liues; wee muſt chaunge our vices into ſo many vertues, and ſo turne to our gracious God, as if neuer more wee would returne vnto ſinne. For mourning is in vaine, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> if we ſinne againe. Great ſinnes, ſaith Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> craue great weeping &amp; lamentation; the Angels in heauen ſing at this lamentation, neither doth the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any ſo ſweete muſick in the eares of God. And if wee will purge our ſelues from the filthines of our ſinnes, wee muſt often rince our ſelues with teares, wee muſt vndergoe the agonie of repentance, mingle our drinke with weeping, water our couches with teares, <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.6.</note> yea the very bloud (as it were) of our ſoules muſt guſh out of our eyes. <hi>O that our head</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>were waters,</hi>

                  <hi>and our eyes a fountaine

Repentance is a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſime of teares; &amp; the greater that our fall hath bin, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt bee the terrent of our teares. It is naturall to men that their lamentation bee in ſome ſort anſwerable to their loſſe. <hi>Naamans</hi> bodie muſt bee ſeuen times waſhed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and our ſoules ſeuentie times ſeuen times purified by repentance.</p>

               <p>We muſt repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t inſtantly &amp; continually without any delay. God wil not permit vs to giue the prime daies to the diuell,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1365:77"/> the dog-dayes to him, to poure out our wine to the world, and to ſerue him with the dregges. Wee may not repent by quauers and ſtarts, but goe through ſtitch. We muſt follow repentance as the widdow in the Goſpell did her ſuite, <note place="margin">Luke 18.40.</note> and keepe our hold as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in wreſtling. <note place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note> Amend to day, amend to morrow, runne on, not for a time, but euen our whole time with a continued act; immoderately at the firſt time, conſtantly in the midſt, and cheerefully to the end. All the trees in Gods orchard muſt bee Palmes, and Cedars; Palmes, which bring forth fruit betimes, and Cedars, whoſe fruit laſteth very long.</p>
               <p>And let vs conſider well the manifold dangers which follow the want either of ſpeede, or continuance in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Firſt our liues of all things are moſt vncertaine, as we haue at large obſerued in the firſt diuiſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 25.6.</note> The fooliſh Virgins ſuppoſed the Bridegroome would not come like a bat in the night; there is time enough (ſaid they) to repent, what needs all this haſt? But poore fooles they were excluded. Many thouſands are now (no doubt) in hell, who purpoſed in time to haue repented; but being preuented by death, are fallen into the burning lake there to be tormented for euer. Therefore let vs eſteem it as an immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger to liue in that eſtate, wherein we would be loath that death might finde vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly bad cuſtomes are dangerous, and greatly to be feared. Hee that from his youth hath wickedlie in his old age ſhall haue ſinne in his bones, <note place="margin">Iob 20.11.</note> 
                  <hi>his bones</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>are full of the ſinnes of his youth, which ſhall ly downe with him in the duſt.</hi> Sinnes are not like diſeaſes in the body, the older the ſorer, but (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) the older the ſweeter, and yet the more toothſome the more troubleſome. The Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſt could not caſt out a foule ſpirit that had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in one from his childehood; <note place="margin">Mark. 9.18.21.</note> hee that hath had long poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion will plead preſcription; a cuſtome long retained is not quickly changed; and therefore it is very dangerous not to repent before we can ſin no more.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1365:77"/>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt remember that the longer we continue in ſin without repentance, the further wee runne from God. And there is no great likelyhood that hee that hath beene running from God forty, fiftie, or perhaps three or foure ſcore yeares together, and with the Prodigall runneth into a farre Countrey, can returne againe in the ſpace of ſix dayes, ſix howers, ſix minutes; for it may bee his ſicknes (vnto which time he deferreth his repentance) will not be ſo long as the ſhorteſt of theſe times, how then is it poſſible to turne in time to our God by repentance? Neither is this a worke of one day or two, as it is ſaid in the book of <hi>Ezra</hi> in another caſe. <hi>Salomon</hi> giueth a young man counſell to remember his Creator in the daies of his youth, <note place="margin">Ezra. 10.13.</note> earely to begin repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, in the prime and bud of his life, <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.1.</note> while hee is freſh and gallant, and not to tarry till the dead winter of age cauſe his buds to fade, and leafe to fall, or till the brawne of his ſtrong armes fall away, or till the keepers of the houſe (the hands which defend the body) tremble, or til euery thing bee a burthen, feeing euen then the graſſe-hopper ſhall bee a burthen; or till they wax darke (the eyes) that looke out at the windowes, or till the grinders ceaſe, that is, his teeth fall out of his head, or till the doores of his lippes bee ſhut, and iawes fallen, or till the daughters of ſinging (the eares) be abaſed, being not able any longer to heare the voice or ſound of Inſtruments, or till it bee too late to knocke, <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.3.4.</note> when the Lords doore is made faſt, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.12.</note> and there ſhall bee no more opening.</p>
               <p>And leſt this young man ſhould thinke the terme of his age (which <hi>Salomon</hi> cals the euill day or time) to be the moſt conuenient time and terme of beginning repentance, in the verſes following he brings the old man, deafe, blinde, lame, ſhort-winded, full of aches and diſeaſes in his body, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling vpon his ſtaffe, his lippes and hands ſhaking, without memorie, and almoſt robbed of his ſences; as if hee ſhould ſay: looke my ſonne, is this man fit to learne or repent, who cannot heare, ſpeake, ſee, goe, nor remember? Thus
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1365:78"/> 
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> ſchooleth his young man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 2.22.29.</note> Further God requiring the firſt borne for his offering, and the firſt fruites for his ſeruice, doth (no doubt) require the prime and maiden-head of euery mans worke, <note place="margin">Leuit. 23.10.</note> and that we ſhould repent betimes, and ſerue him with our firſt and beſt meanes.</p>
               <p>It is for yong men to beleeve. And therefore the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Creede (which is both for yong &amp; old) ſaith, I doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. In the Leuiticall temple, there was a morning offering as well as an euening ſacrifice. And when the Angell of the couenant ſtirreth the poole, that is, offereth ſaluation, not he that is oldeſt, <note place="margin">Iohn 5.2.</note> but he that ſteppes in firſt (yong or old) is healed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.16. Coloſ. 4.5.</note> Some, ſay that youth muſt haue a time, but Chriſtians muſt redeeme the whole both of youth and yeares. For here God will not be ſatisfied with the firſt fruits, as in the legall Prieſt-hood, but muſt haue the whole crop of time offered to him in his ſeruice, and performance of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Eliſha</hi> could ſay to his ſeruant is this a time to take rewards? And amidſt the pangs of death, is that a time to thinke of amendement of life?</p>
               <p>Againe let vs remember that in time of ſickneſſe wee thinke moſt vpon that which wee moſt feele. Death doth beſiege vs, ſinne affrighteth vs, our wiues grieue vs, our children with-draw vs; being many waies diſtracted, how ſhall we then repent and amend? Being then at the weakeſt; how can we reſiſt <hi>Sathan,</hi> who is then at the ſtrongeſt? Our repentance then will be late repentance, and late repentance is neuer or very ſeldome true repentance; according to this ſaying, <hi>ſera poenitentia rarò eſt vera, ſed vera poenitentia nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eſt ſera;</hi> late repentance is ſeldome true, but true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is neuer too late. Alſo thoſe repentance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> that men frame to themſelues at the laſt houre, are but falſe concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that come not to bearing; for in ſuch repentance men forſake not their ſinnes, but their ſinnes forſake them. It will be too late to come to the kay when the ſhip is launched, too
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1365:78"/> late to tranſplant trees, when they be many yeares growne, too late to ſeaſon fleſh, when it crawleth with wormes, too late to mend a houſe when it is on fire; ſo ſtands the caſe with him that hath liued long in ſinne without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Such as by their prophanneſſe, doe wilfully refuſe the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Gods mercy, and do prefere their pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits before it, may runne ſo farre, that all the meanes they can vſe ſhall neuer obtaine mercy at the hands of God. I ſay as there is a time in the which the Lord will wooe vs, yea he ſends his Miniſters to intreat vs, hee will chide and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the matter with vs, why we will not accept of his mercy. <hi>O Ephraim</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>what ſhall I doe vnto thee,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.4.</note> 
                  <hi>O Iuda what ſhall I doe vnto thee?</hi> So there is and will be a time that after the refuſing of grace, and contemning of mercy offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Lord will ſhut vp and bolt the gate of mercie, ſo as he will not be entreated at our hands any more. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto vs by the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in one of his Pſalmes, <note place="margin">Pſal. 95.7.8.</note> where he exhorts the people that they will take and accept the time the Lord offers them, leſt it come to paſſe by their contempt, and refuſing the time of grace, the Lord caſt them off and reiect them.</p>
               <p>I deny not, but that in reſpect of vs, till God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his will, there is hope; but in reſpect of Gods ſecret decree, the time of Gods mercie may bee out euen during this life; therefore when mercie is offered, wee muſt take heed we wilfully cotemne it not, leſt we prouoke the Lord to be gone, and vtterly to reiect vs.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt feareful ſignes of a Caſt-away is to delay and put off the Lords gratious offer of mercy; as we reade of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who when <hi>Moſes</hi> offered himſelfe to pray to the Lord for him, he put it off till the next morrow; <note place="margin">Exod. 8.9.10.</note> ſo he that hath the mercies and graces of God offered him to day, and puts them off from his youth to his age, and from his old daies till his death-bed, may iuſtly feare an vtter reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen then when he hopes for moſt comfort.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1365:79"/>
               <p>And as it is moſt certaine that after death, teares are fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, repentance vnprofitable, as after death no mercie is to be expected, nothing but miſerie, nothing but wrath, ſo is it doubtfull and very dangerous, that our ſighes, teares, and groanes, are of little force at the very neere approach of death, whether by age, extremitie of diſeaſe, or otherwiſe. For at that time when our powers are diſtracted or ſpent, when no part is free eyther from the ſence or feare of his cruell gripe, we may well be ſaid to be in death, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſuch a condition or ſtate that doth leſſe participate of life then death. And therefore at the leaſt it is doubtfull that at that time we ſhall not remember God, and that our repentance ſhall come too late.</p>
               <p>What a ſhame is it that the children of this world are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer in their kind, then the children of light?

The Lawyer will take the terme, becauſe he knoweth that it being ended, his clients will be gone. So we ought to make euery day the day of our terme, and a prouident man will repent him of his ſinnes in the ſeaſonable time of health and ſtrength, and not protract till hee bee in the very armes and the imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death; when many occaſions may cut from him either his minde or power, or time to repent. For we haue iuſt cauſe to feare, that if we would not when we might, we ſhall not be able when we would, and that by our will to do euill, we may happily loſe the power to doe well. Thy very tongue will condemne thee in thy trade: if thou truſt a man
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1365:79"/> with thy wares, thou wilt require a bill or bond, ſaying, all men are mortall, and at leſſe then an houres warning. But let the Preacher exhort thee to accept of the gratious time of the Lord, and put thee in minde that thy life, as a vapour, is ſoone gone, yet thou wilt not beleeue him, but ſo lead thy life in ſinne, as if thou hadſt the ſame in ſee farme.</p>
               <p>And to thee that calleſt thy neighbours, friends and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to Cards, Dice, or any ſuch paſtime, ſaying, come let vs goe paſſe the time away. Is time ſo ſlow that it muſt be driuen? I tell thee there are at this day many thouſands in hell, who if they had many kingdoms, would gladly giue them all, for one houre of that time, whereof thou haſt many, not to paſſe it away or driue it from them, but in hope to recouer that which thou doſt moſt graceleſſely contemne.</p>
               <p>Alas, who dares truſt to the broken reed of extreame ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or age, bruiſed by originall, but altogether broken by our actuall ſinnes. We haue good cauſe not to truſt to this deferring of time, and late repentance. For if <hi>Eſau</hi> could not finde repentance, albeit he ſought it with teares; <note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> how may we with good reaſon ſuſpect our extreame late ſeeking for repentance? Not becauſe true repentance can euer bee too late, but becauſe late repentance is ſeldome true, (as wee haue alreadie heard) <hi>Et ſera rarò ſeria,</hi> that which is late is ſeldome liuely, as proceeding rather from feare, then from loue, from neceſſitie, then from willingneſſe, and deſire, rather outwardly pretended, then with the heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>We all of vs in our iolitie, thinke we may doe what wee liſt, and ſo long as God forbeares to puniſh, we will neuer forbeare to ſin, but ſtill deferre the time of repentance. But God grant we may remember and lay to our hearts, what that good Father Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nihil eſt infoelicius, &amp;c.</hi> Nothing is more infortunate then the felicitie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whereby there penall impietie is nouriſhed, and their malice ſtrengthened and increaſed. When God doth ſuffer
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1365:80"/> ſinners to proſper, then his indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the greater toward them (ſaith that Father) and when hee leaueth them vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, then he puniſheth them moſt of all.</p>
               <p>For the further preſſing of this doctrine on our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let vs obſerue ſome places of Scripture. And firſt let vs ſee what the Lord ſaith to ſuch as deſpiſe wiſdomes call; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, that like fooles content themſelues with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond that ſcoffe at the Lords offer by his ſeruants.</p>
               <p>The third which are carried away by their owne luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 1.24.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe I haue called, and yee refuſed, I haue ſtretched out my hand, and none would regard, and then they ſhall call vpon mee, but I will not anſwere; they ſhall ſeeke me early, but ſhall not finde me.</hi> Noting to vs, that as they did refuſe the time in which he called, ſo they ſhould call in hope of mercy, but finde none. <note place="margin">Eſay 23.12.13.</note> The like we reade how the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> calling Ieruſalem to repentance in ſack-cloath and aſhes for their ſinnes; ſhee fell to ſporting and feaſting, deſpiſing the Lords meſſage, and offer of grace by his Prophet; what came of it? You may reade preſently, that their contempt comming to the Lords eares, he doth anſwere. Surely this iniquitie ſhall not bee purged from you till you die (ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes) giuing them to vnderſtand, that ſeeing they ſet ſo light by the admonitions of the Prophet, there ſhould bee left them no time to repent in, till hee had deſtroyed them. But of all the places of Scripture for this purpoſe, let vs ſee what the Lord ſaith to Ieruſalem by his Prophet <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 24.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I would haue purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged, till I haue cauſed my wrath to light vpon thee.</hi> Marke this Place well, which may terrifie our hearts, (if we carry not the hearts of Tygers) in which the Lord teſtifies not onely to them, but to vs, then when by all kinde meanes and louing allurements, hee offereth his fauour, and we obſtinately refuſe it, let vs be ſure, then when wee would haue mercy and fauour from him, though wee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1365:80"/> begge it, crying and howling, he will deny vs. For there is a time ſet in which we may repent, but being deſpiſed and outrun, there is after no houre to obtaine mercy. The reaſons whereof are ſpeciallly three. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt taken from God, who, becauſe it proceedes from his loue to offer mercy, it muſt needs ſtand with his iuſtice to puniſh the wilfull contempt of it, with a perpetuall deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of mercy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond from Sathan, who by contemning and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Lords gratious offer of mercy, gets great aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of vs, and hereby makes a way for ſuch ſinnes as hardly in time we can repent vs of.</p>
               <p>The third is from the nature of this ſinne which hatcheth three horrible ſinnes; for delay breeds cuſtome, cuſtome breeds ſecuritie, and ſecurity breedes impenitencie. A drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, wee ſee, is more eaſily reclaymed from that ſinne at the firſt, then when hee hath gotten the cuſtome of it; and ſo it is of all other ſinnes. And hence it is that the Lord by his Prophet doth note it a thing impoſſible in reſpect of humane power to leaue thoſe ſinnes which are cuſtomab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed, ſaying. <hi>Can the black-more change his skin,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 13.23.</note> 
                  <hi>or the Leopard his ſpots, then may yee alſo doe good, that are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh beloued, let vs take heede of deſpiſing the Lords kind offer of mercy, leſt hee bee angry, <note place="margin">Pſal. 2.13.</note> and ſo wee periſh in his wrath. For which cauſe let vs call to remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce theſe foure motiues to mooue vs to accept of the time of grace, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.2.</note> this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable day of ſaluation. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, how mercifull the Lord hath beene to vs, who might haue cut off our time in our youth, in which it may be wee were vnthriftie, or in the midſt of ſome grieuous ſinne. that we commited heretofore, or of late daies, and ſo haue ſent vs to hell.</p>
               <p>Secondly, conſider how many good motions of his holy ſpirit wee haue let ſlip, and made light accompt of, and ſent him away from vs with griefe, which it may be we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer enioy againe.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:1365:81"/>
               <p>Thirdly call to thy minde how hee hath this day offered thee his Maieſties gratious pardon vpon thy willing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, which for ought that either I or thou know, he will neuer offer againe vnto thee.</p>
               <p>Fourthly conſider that at the Lord hath giuen thee a time, ſo he hath giuen thee thy ſences, thy wittes, thy memory, which hee hath depriued others of, and may thee alſo, for ought thou knoweſt, becauſe thou haſt made no better vſe of them for his glory, and thy owne ſaluation. Therefore ſay, Lord turne mee vnto thee, and deliuer my ſoule, enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten my vnderſtanding, from this groſſe darkeneſſe, free my deſires from theſe iron chaines, from theſe maſſie fetters of ſin, that I may turne vnto thee in the ſeaſonable time of health and ſtrength; and not deferre the great and waightie worke of my repentance, vntill either by long cuſtome of ſin, or by debility of body or minde or both, I ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think vpon thee.</p>
               <p>But ſome will obiect, what is there no hope of ſaluation for him that repenteth at the laſt houre? Anſwer. I will not ſay (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) he ſhall be ſaued, I will not ſay he ſhall be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. You wil ſay, the theefe was ſaued at the very laſt caſt of life, <note place="margin">Luke 23.43:</note> or ſome ſhort time before he departed from the croſſe to paradiſe. Anſwer. I confeſſe that the ſcripture ſpeaketh of ſuch a one crucified at the right hand of the ſon of God, who crauing with faith mercy to ſaluation, receiued this anſwer, <hi>to day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe.</hi> Hee was called at the eleuenth houre at the poynt of the twelfe, when hee was now dying and drawing on; and therefore his conuerſion was altogether miraculous and extraordinary. And there was a ſpeciall reaſon why our Sauiour Chriſt would haue him to be then called; that while he was in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he might ſhew forth the vertue of his paſſion, that all which ſaw the one, might alſo acknowledge the other. Now it is not good for any man to make an ordinary rule of an extraordinary example, and beſides the ſcripture ſpeakes but of one that was ſo ſaued; and it ſpeakes of another in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1365:81"/> that very place, and at that very inſtant that was damned. And herevpon a father ſaith, we reade of one, that no man ſhould deſpaire, and but of one, that no man ſhould preſume. And vpon this alſo <hi>Origen</hi> writeth thus, there is no man hath cauſe to deſpaire of pardon, ſeeing Chriſt ſaid vnto the theefe <hi>verily this day thou ſhalt be with me in paradiſe,</hi> and yet may not too much preſume of pardon, becauſe Chriſt ſaid not verely this day ſhall yee be with me in paradize.</p>
               <p>This example therefore is a medicine onely againſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and no cloake for ſinne. And therefore let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member before we ſinne, that Chriſt pardoned not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and thereby feare his iuſtice; and after wee haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let vs remember that Chriſt pardoned the theefe; and ſo hope for mercy. <hi>Etſi poenitentia eſt ſera, tamen indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non eſt fera.</hi> Saith <hi>Lombard</hi> Gods mercy is aboue our miſery, and an euening ſacrifice is accepted by him; &amp; yet on the other ſide we neuer reade that Chriſt cured one blind man often, that hee healed the ſame leapers diuers times, that he raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> twice. Marke well (ſaith one) what I ſay, that a man which repenteth not but at his latter end ſhall be damned; I doe not ſay ſo, what then doe I ſay? He ſhall be ſaued? No. What then doe I ſay? I ſay I know not, I ſay I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not, I promiſe not, will thou then deliuer thy ſelfe out of this doubt? Wilt thou eſcape this dangerous poynt? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thou then whilſt thou art whole, for if thou repent whilſt thou art in health, whenſoeuer the laſt day of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vpon thee thou art ſafe, for that thou didſt repent in that time when thou mighteſt yet haue ſinned: but if thou wilt repent when thou canſt ſinne no longer, thou leaueſt not ſinne but ſinne leaueth thee. One being demaunded when it was time to repent, anſwered, one day before our Death; but when it was replyed, that no man knew that day; he ſaid, begin then to day, for feare of fayling; and boaſt not of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth: many pretend to mend all in time, and this time is ſo deferred from day to day vntill God (in whoſe hands one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1365:82"/> all times conſiſt) doth ſhut them out of all time and ſend them to paines eternall with out time, for that they abuſe the ſpeciall benefit of time in this world.</p>
               <p>Againe concerning thoſe which poſt off their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance til age, ſicknes, or death; of theſe there are ſpecially two ſorts. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſort are ſuch as plead the ſweete promiſes of the Goſpell, <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.21. Mat. 11.28.</note> as namely theſe. <hi>At what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent &amp;c. Come vnto me all yee that labour and are heauie loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will refreſh you.</hi> Anſwer. True it is and moſt true, but to whom are theſe promiſes made, and to what ſinners? They are made to all repentant ſinners that turne to the Lord with all their hearts, but thou art an vnrepentant wretch and continueſt in thy ſinnes, therefore thoſe comfortable promiſes belong not vnto thee. And what ſinners doth he bid come vnto him? Thoſe that be weary and heauie laden, that is, whoſe ſins pinch and wound them at the very heart, and withall deſire to be eaſed of the burthen of them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take not occaſion to preſume of the promiſes of the Goſpell; for vnleſſe thou turne from thy euill wayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thy ſinnes, they belong nothing at all vnto thee. I know the Goſpell is a booke of mercy, I know that in the Prophets there are many aſperſions of mercy; I know that out of the eater comes meat, and out of the ſtrong comes ſweeteneſſe; and that in the ten commandements (which be the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of death) there is made expreſſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mercy, I will haue mercy vpon thouſands; yea, the very firſt words of them are the couenant of grace, I am the Lord thy God; yet, if euery leafe and euery line, and euery word in the bible were nothing but mercy, mercy: yet nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes the preſumptuous ſinner that lies rotting in his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities; O but he is mercifull, gratious, ſlow to anger, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſſe and truth, reſeruing mercy for thouſands, forgiuing iniquitie, tranſgreſſion, and ſinne; is not here mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy mentioned nine or ten times together? It is, but read on the very next words, and not making the wicked innocent,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1365:82"/> viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children, and vpon childrens children vnto the third and fourth generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: is not this the terrible voice of iuſtice? But ſtay, in the 136 Pſal. there is nothing but his mercy endureth for euer which is the foote of the Pſal. and is found ſix and twentie times in 26 verſes, yet harke what a ratling thunder-clappe is heere, and ouerthrew <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt in the red ſea, and ſmote great Kinges, and ſlew mighty Kings &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are ſuch, that by reading and hearing of the ſtory of <hi>Lots</hi> drunkennes, of <hi>Dauids</hi> adultery, of <hi>Peters</hi> deniall, doe thereby bleſſe themſelues, and ſtrengthen and comfort their hearts, yea they haue learned to alledge them as examples to extenuate their ſinnes, and to preſume that they ſhall finde the like mercy. Am I a Drunkard? (ſaith one) ſo was that good man <hi>Lot.</hi> Am I an Adulterer? (ſaith ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſo was <hi>Dauid,</hi> a man after Gods owne heart. Am I a ſwearer, a forſwearer, a curſer, a denyer of Chriſt? So was the holy Apoſtle Saint Peter. Shall I deſpaire of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaith the wicked perſiſter in ſinne, and I read that the theefe repented on the croſſe, and found mercy at the laſt houre? O vile wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, who hath bewitched you to peruert Gods word to your deſtruction? It is as much as to poyſon the ſoule. Look on their repentance. <hi>Lot</hi> fell of infirmitie, and no doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented with much griefe; yet looke vpon Gods iudgment vpon that inceſtuous ſeede. Looke vpon <hi>Dauid.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.</note> Read the 38 Pſalme, it made him grow crooked, his ſinnes were as fire in his bones; he had not a good day to his death, but the griefe of his ſinnes made him to roare out; thou wouldſt be loath to buy thy ſinne ſo deere as he did. Looke vpon <hi>Peter</hi> who wept for his ſinnes moſt bitterly. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.75.</note> And as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the theefe (as wee haue heard already, and cannot heare too often) ſeeing it is ſo often obiected and vrged; the Lord knocketh but once by one ſermon, and he repented, but thou haſt heard many ſermons crying and calling vnto thee, and yet thou haſt not repented; and this is as wee haue heard) an extraordinary example, and thereof not the like in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1365:83"/> all the ſcripture againe; and the Lord hath ſet out but one, and yet one, that noe man ſhould deſpaire, and yet that noe man ſhould preſume by this one example, for what man will ſpurre his Aſſe till he ſpeake, <note place="margin">Num. 22.28.</note> becauſe <hi>Balaam</hi> did ſo, and yet one, that no man ſhould deſpaire, but to know that God is a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble to call home at the laſt houre. And by this he did declare the riches of his mercy to all ſuch as haue grace to turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; where contrary we ſee, many thouſands of thoſe, who hauing deferred their repentance, haue beene taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their ſinnes, and dyed impenitent. But this example is for all penitent ſinners, who vpon their hearty repentance may aſſure themſelues that the Lord will receiue them to mercy. Now if thou canſt promiſe to thy ſelfe the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith in Chriſt, that he had, then maiſt thou promiſe thy ſelfe the ſame felicitie which he now enioyes.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> cals the hiſtory of this man, <hi>pulcherrimum af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectandae conuerſionis exemplum,</hi> a moſt goodly example to moue men to turne to God. But looke thou on his fellow, who had no grace to repent, and who hangs as an example to all impenitent wretches to looke vpon, that they deſpiſe not the mercie of God, nor reiect his call by his meſſengers and Miniſters, leſt it come to paſſe, that when they would repent they cannot.</p>
               <p>To thee then that art priuie, thou haſt had many calles, many offers of grace, yea that haſt ſeene the painfull and faithfull Preachers of Gods holy Word &amp; Sacraments, ſpend their wits, their ſtrength, yea ouerſpend themſelues for thy good, what diuell hath bewitched thee to poſt off all, and willingly to caſt away thy ſelfe?</p>
               <p>To thee therefore, that doſt ſtrengthen thy ſelfe in thy ſinnes vpon preſumption of mercie to others, I referre thee to the words that the Lord himſelfe ſpeakes in <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29.19.20.</note> 
                  <hi>He that when he heareth the words of this curſe, bleſſeth himſelfe in his heart ſaying, I ſhall haue peace, though I walke according to the ſtubborneneſſe of my owne heart, thus adding drunkenneſſe to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him, nor be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1365:83"/> vnto him, but the wrath of the Lord and his iealouſie ſhall ſmoake againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this booke ſhall light vpon him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from vnder heauen.</hi> Beſides this place, there are many others in the Scriptures againſt thoſe that ſtrengthen their hearts in their ſinnes. If you preſume that a Lord Lord will ſerue the turne at the cloſe of your life, it is nothing elſe but <hi>Infidelis fiducia,</hi> a faithleſſe confidence, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> calls it.</p>
               <p>Againe, by that parable in the Goſpell of the Labourers, <note place="margin">Mat. 20.1. &amp;c.</note> that were called into the Vineyard at ſeuerall houres in the day, doe many wicked men take great incouragement to neglect the time of their calling, &amp; repentance, becauſe they that were called in the laſt houre were accepted, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded equally with thoſe, which came in the firſt houre of the day. But ſhew me which of thoſe labourers, being called, did refuſe to come. It ſeemeth rather vnto mee, that hereby they ſhould learne without delay to repent, when they are called to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, at what time ſoeuer it be, for he is not bound to vs, but we to him. Hee that ſaith, <hi>when the wicked man turneth from his wickedneſſe that he hath committed,</hi>

                  <hi>and doth that which is lawfull and right, ſhall ſaue his ſoule aliue,</hi> doth ſay alſo. <hi>It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 3.27.</note> for old age is like to flint, you may breake it before you can ſoften it. In youth ſinnes are few and feeble, but by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance they grow to be as ſtrong as Giants, and increaſe into mightie armies. And where <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid before to the yong man, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the daies of thy youth;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.1.</note> in the ſame verſe hee alſo ſheweth the reaſon of the ſame, and therfore ſaith, <hi>Before thy euill dayes come, and yeares approach, wherein thou ſhalt ſay, I haue no pleaſure in them.</hi> Theſe are the reaſons for which <hi>Salomon</hi> would haue his yong man not to put off in the age of youth (which is moſt prime, and teachable) the remembrance of his Creator, and his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and they are taken from the many infirmities and withdrawings that are to be found in old age, when youth
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1365:84"/> is abuſed: As much as if <hi>Salomon</hi> ſhould haue ſaid; Well, my ſonne, thou art now yong, luſtie and actiue, of good ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and ſharpe conceit, indued with freſh and ſtrong faculties of wit and remembrance, thy feete are nimble, thy ſight is good, and thy hearing perfect, now therefore ſerue God, and repent, whiles thou mayeſt; the time will come, when thou wilt be old, weake, and ſickly, dull in apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and of bad capacitie and remembrance, without good legges to bring thee to Church, without a good eare to heare at Church, and either without eyes, or darke-ſighted, and not able to reade long, nor to ſee a good letter, but tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſpectacles. Then it will bee too late to doe any good ſeruice to God thy Creator. This I take to bee the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans meaning in theſe words; which teacheth vs that old age is no fit time wherein to begin repentance and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when the greene and freſh age of youth hath beene conſumed in vanities.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites are complained of by the Lord in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachy,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 1.8.</note> that they offered the blinde for ſacrifice, and the lame and ſicke for a hallowed thing. <hi>And if yee offer the blinde for ſacrifice, is it not euill? and if yee offer the lame and ſicke, is it not euill? Offer it now vnto the Gouernour, will he be pleaſed with thee? or accept of thy perſon? ſaith the Lord of Hoſtes.</hi> He that would not haue a beaſt (while he had no eyes) in his ſeruice, would haue thee, while thou haſt eyes, to ſerue him; the ſicke and the lame were no good offerings then, <note place="margin">Leu. 22.20.</note> as being forbidden in the Law, and be they good ware now in the ſicke and lame bodie of a man, that hath deſperately put off his repentance, and turning to God, till he can neither draw winde nor legge? <hi>Moſes</hi> knew this, and therefore bore this burden yong, and whiles his legges were able to beare him; for the text ſaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 11.24.</note> That <hi>when he was come to age, he refuſed to be called the ſon of</hi> Pharaohs <hi>daughter,</hi> that is, would not liue in delicacies, while he had ſtrength to liue vnto God. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> alſo in his beautie, and faire perſon, turned his backe to his tempting Miſtreſſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 39.10.12.</note> and his face to the Lord, hee would not

What? So ſoone and ſo yong? So ſaith the Scripture; and ſo it was without controuerſie. For Gods children take the good dayes of youth for good duties, and not the euill dayes of ſickly and ſapleſſe old age, as commonly the children of the world doe. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſerued God in his minoritie, <note place="margin">1.

               <p>The reaſons why we muſt thus begin to repent betimes, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, repentance, as it can neuer come too ſoone, where ſinne is gone before, ſo it muſt needs with much adoe, and not without ſome ſpeciall worke of God, ouertake ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes of youth and manhood, ſo farre, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, old age is full of wearineſſe and trouble, and where we haue elbow-roome in youth, we cannot turne vs in old age; perhaps we ſhall neither heare, nor ſee, nor goe, nor ſit, without paine and torment in all parts; and is this (ſay you) a fit condition of life, and time of age to ſerue God in. But ſay that the forcible working of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, like a great gale of winde, be able to blow thee home on the ſodaine, yet art thou not ſure to haue it. And doeſt thou thinke, ſeeing thou wilt not repent &amp; know God in youth, that hee will know thee at theſe yeeres, and in this caſe and ſtate? And wilt thou beſtow on Satan the beautie, ſtrength and freſhneſſe of youth, &amp; offer to God the wrinkles, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and foule hew of old age? or when thou haſt giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the flower of thy youth to Gods enemie, wilt thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1365:85"/> to God (who will haue the firſt, and deſerues the beſt) the dregges and leauings? To all ſuch I ſay, if you will not know God in your youth, hee will neuer know thee, (for ought that thou knoweſt) when thou art gray-headed. If (as hath beene ſaid) thou wilt not giue him the yong and ſound, and that which is without blemiſh, he will neuer take in good part the old and ſicke, and euill fauoured, which no man will giue to his friend, nor dare offer to his prince. If thou wilt not, when thou art quick-witted, when thou art come to the yeares of dotage, he will not. If thou wilt not heare him in his day, thou ſhalt crie in thy day, that is, in the euill day, and ſhalt not bee heard. Yea God hath told thee (as we haue ſaid before) <hi>Becauſe I haue called and you refuſed, you ſhall call vpon me,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 1.24.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will not anſwere you.</hi> A dolefull and heauie doome for a dying man. It is too late to ſow, when thy fruite ſhould be in, and no time to leaue ſinne, when ſin muſt leaue thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 16.24: Heb. 12.17. Mat. 25.11.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Diues</hi> prayed, but was not heard. <hi>Eſau</hi> wept, but was not pitied. The fooliſh Virgins knocked, but were denied. By which fearefull examples it appeareth, that it will be too late to call for mercie after this life, when the gates of mercie will be ſhut vp, and repentance comes too late. For if wee through our negligence and careleſſeneſſe ouerſlip this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, which the Lord in mercie offereth vs, we cannot recouer it afterward, although wee ſeeke it with teares; which we find truely verified by the fore-alledged fearefull examples. <note place="margin">Eſay 59.2.</note> 
                  <hi>For your iniquities haue ſeperated betweene you and your God, and your ſinnes, haue hid his face from you, that hee will not heare.</hi> It is therefore the ſureſt and ſafeſt way, and better by many degrees, for the ſaluation of our ſoules, to leaue our ſinnes now in our youth, and now to repent in our health, then hereafter (alas!) when it may be too late.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures pointeth vs to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time and exhorteth vs to make that the time of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and vpon this Theme many of the holy men of God ſpent their Sermons. Looke in <hi>Eſay, Ieremie</hi> and the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1365:85"/> reſt, and you ſhall euer finde that they beate vpon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time. <note place="margin">Eſay 55. Ier. 35. Heb. 3. Pſal. 95. Ioel. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Now turne vnto the Lord; now whiles it is called to day; to day if yee will heare his voice, this is the accepted time;</hi> and therefore wee may not come for it many yeeres hence, being promiſed to day.</p>
               <p>Iniquitie did then abound (as now it doth) and procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination was euer dangerous, and therefore they iudged no doctrine ſo fitte, as often to vrge repentance without all delay.</p>
               <p>So that now euen now is the time of repentance, euen now whilſt he calleth, now whileſt he ſpeaketh, now whilſt hee knocketh, now let vs take vp this day, and make it the ioyfull day of our repentance. <hi>For ioy ſhall be in heauen</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour in the Goſpell) <note place="margin">Luke 15.7.</note> 
                  <hi>ouer one ſinner that repenteth.</hi> Therefore let vs now ſay, this ſhalbe my day of repentance, I will deferre it no longer; and ſo let vs repent from day to day, euen to our dying day; and then whoſoeuer ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo repenting to the end, hee ſhall ſurely and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be ſaued.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now for concluſion of this duetie of repentance, marke heere how happily we fall vpon repentance; God grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to fall vpon vs. It is a grace (when it fals vpon a ſinfull ſoule) that makes the Diuels murmure, <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> and vex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in hell, and the good Angels reioyce in heauen.</p>
               <p>This is that which makes the eternall Wiſdome content to forget our iniquities, and to remember them no more, then if they had neuer beene; and this is <hi>Magnaſpongia</hi> (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calles it) the great ſpunge that wipes them all away out of the ſight of God: this ſpeakes to mercy to ſeperate our ſinnes from the face of God, to binde them vp in bundles, and drowne them in the ſea of obliuion: this is that mourning Maſter, that is neuer without good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, teares of contrition, prayers for remiſſion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a mended life. This makes <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a Saint: <hi>Zacheus</hi> of an extortioner, charitable; and of perſecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> a profeſſing <hi>Paul.</hi> Repentance is the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſedeas</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1365:86"/> that diſchargeth all bonds of ſinne. Behold the office of repentance, ſhee ſtandeth at the doore, and offers her louing ſeruice; entertaine mee, and I will vnloade thy heart of that euill poyſon, and returne it to thee emptie, though it were full to the brimme. <hi>Peccaſti? poenitere; mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies peccaſti? millies poenitere; millies poenitet? adhuc etiam poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitere:</hi> Haſt thou ſinned? repent; haſt thou a thouſand times ſinned? why then a thouſand times repent: haſt thou repented a thouſand times? I ſay deſpaire not, but ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take thy ſelfe to repentance.</p>
               <p>If you welcome repentance, knocking at your dore from God, it ſhall knocke at Gods doore of mercy for you. It askes of you amendment, of God forgiueneſſe. Receiue it therefore and imbrace it.</p>
               <p>The fourth dutie is to die in prayer; for when it ſhall pleaſe God in the weakneſſe of our bodies, to giue vs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our mortality and our end: let vs pray to God for grace, that we may ſpend the time of our ſickneſſe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods word and comfortable bookes, in godly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in holy meditation, and in feruent prayer to the Lord: firſt for patience in thy ſickneſſe: ſecondly, for comfort in Chriſt Ieſus: thirdly, for ſtrength in his mercy: and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for deliuerance at his good pleaſure; yea endeuour as much as thou canſt to die praying. For when thou art in the depthes of miſeries, and at it were at the gates of death, there is a depth of Gods mercie, who is readie to heare and helpe thee: for miſery muſt call vpon mercie, and Prayer is the chiefeſt thing that a man may preſent God withall. For by prayer we are oftentimes in ſpirit (with the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) rapt vp into the third heauens, <note place="margin">2.

               <p>Too too many there are that when God viſits them with ſharpe diſeaſes, that wakens vp their conſciences, and then ſicke, ſicke, and then if God will repriue them vntill a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger day, oh what Chriſtians courſes they vow to take, God proues them they mend in bodies, yeeres: in manners? no, no more then Pharaoh after the plagues remoueall: for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in their afflictions and ſickneſſes looking for death, how liberall are they in their promiſes? but afterward how baſely niggardly are they in their performances? they play childrens play with God, they take away a thing aſſoone as they haue giuen it.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Preacher ſaith, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.1.</note> That <hi>the day of our death, is better then the day of our birth.</hi> In which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of holy Scripture for our comfort at death, three points are to be conſidered. Firſt, what is death that is heere mentioned. Secondly, how it can be truely (that is heere mentioned) ſaid, that the day of our death is better then the day of our birth. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what reſpect it is better.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Death is a priuation of life, as a puniſhment ordained of God, and impoſed on man for his ſinne. It is a priuation of life, becauſe the very nature of death is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or defect of that life, which God vouchſafed man by his creation. I adde further, that death is a puniſhment, more eſpecially to intimate the nature and qualitie of death, and to ſhew that it was ordained as the meanes of the execution of Gods iudgement and iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in euery puniſhment there bee three wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, the ordainer of it, the procurer, and the executioner.</p>
               <p>The ordainer of this puniſhment is God, in the eſtate of mans innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, by a ſolemne law then made in theſe words. <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> The Executioner of this puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is alſo God himſelfe, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe teſtifieth in the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>I make
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1365:92"/> peace and create euill.</hi> And this is materiall or naturall euill, <note place="margin">Eſay 45.7.</note> to the latter of which, Death is to be referred; which is the deſtruction and aboliſhment of mans nature created.</p>
               <p>The procurer of this puniſhment is not God, but man himſelfe, in that man by ſinne and diſobedience did put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe this puniſhment. Therfore the Lord in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Oſea</hi> ſaith, <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelfe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſea 13.9.</note> 
                  <hi>but in me is thy helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this it may be obiected, that man was mortall in the eſtate of his innocencie before the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere;</hi> The frame and compoſition of mans body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in it ſelfe, was mortall, becauſe it was made of water and earth, and other elements, which are of themſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and changeable; yet if we reſpect the grace and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which God did vouchſafe mans bodie in his creation, it was vnchangeable and immortal, and ſo by the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſhould haue continued, if man had not fallen; and man by his fall, depriuing himſelfe of this gift, and the bleſſing, became euery way mortall. And hereof it is that the Preacher ſaith, <hi>Loe this onely haue I found, that God made man vpright,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but they haue ſought out many inuentions.</hi> Againe, before the fall, mans bodie was but ſubiect to death, and could not then be ſaid to be dead, but after the fall, it was then not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubiect to death, but might alſo be ſaid to bee dead. And therefore now in this reſpect the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.10</note> 
                  <hi>The body is dead becauſe of ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, mans bodie in his innocencie, was like vnto the bodie of Chriſt, when he was vpon the earth, that is, onely ſubiect vnto death, for he could not be ſaid to bee dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in him there was no ſinne; and this was mans caſe in his innocencie before his fall.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeares in part what death is. And yet for the better clearing of this point, wee are to conſider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the death of a man, and a beaſt. The death of a beaſt is the totall and finall aboliſhment of the whole creature; for the body is reſolued to the firſt matter, and the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1365:93"/> ſoule riſing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the temperature of the body, is but a breath, and vaniſheth to nothing. But in the death of a man it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: For though the bodie for a time be reſolued and turned into duſt, out of which it came, yet it muſt riſe againe at the laſt day, and become immortall; but the ſoule ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth by it ſelfe out of the body, and is immortall. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which difference is, for that the ſoule of man is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or ſpirituall ſubſtance, whereas the ſoule of a beaſt is no ſubſtance, but a naturall vigour or qualitie, and hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ſelfe without the body, on which it wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The ſoule of a man contrariwiſe, being created of nothing, <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>God breathed into his noſtrils the breath of life,</hi> and then man became a liuing ſoule, and ſo as well ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting forth of it, as in it. But when God made the beaſts of the earth, he breathed not ſuch matter into them, but their bloud is as their ſoule, <note place="margin">Leuit. 17.14.</note> and their life; for the life of all fleſh is the bloud thereof. <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.20.</note> So that, <hi>when beaſts die, they periſh,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>and that is their end, and their ſpirit goeth downeward to the earth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>but the ſpirit of man goeth vpward,</hi> ſaith the Preacher.</p>
               <p>Saint Ambroſe takes occaſion by this difference, &amp; from the ſhape of mans bodie, to aduertiſe our minde what our affections ſhould be. It is well ordained (ſaith he) that man hath onely two feete with birds, and not foure feete with beaſts, for by this he may learne to flye aloft with the birds, and not with beaſtes encline and decline to the groſſer and earthly things of this world.</p>
               <p>Heere then we ſee, that ſince the fall of man, man is not: only ſubiect to death, but alſo may be ſaid a dead man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhall as ſurely die, as if he were dead already, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwithſtanding he hath a forme and ſhew of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Other things, ſo long as they retaine their forme, ſo long they doe remaine; A houſe falleth not all the time that his forme and faſhion laſteth; the brute beaſt dieth not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt forgoe his life, which is his forme; but man hath a forme which neuer is diſſolued, as namely, a minde
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1365:93"/> endued with reaſon, and yet he liueth now but a very ſhort time, in reſpect that his bodie, by reaſon of ſinne and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is become mortall, whereby man is the procuter of his owne death and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is a true ſaying of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> Man is the worke of God, ſinne is the worke of man; let vs therefore diſcerne what God hath made, and what man hath done; and neither for the error committed by man, let vs hate man, whom God made, nor for the man that is Gods worke, loue the ſinne that man hath committed. And againe here note we muſt hate none in reſpect of his creation, but in reſpect he peruerteth the vſe of his creation, for they beare the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which is louely, but they deface and ſcratch it out to their owne damnation; ſo that we muſt hate not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but <hi>vitium,</hi> the wickedneſſe of the man, and not the wicked as he is man.</p>
               <p>The kinds of death, as we haue heard in the firſt Diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are three-fold; Naturall, Spirituall, Eternall, but they may be reduced into two only, as the kinds of life are, that is, bodily and ſpirituall. Bodily death is nothing elſe but the ſeparation of the ſoule from the body, as bodily life is the coniunction of body and ſoule. And this death is called the firſt, becauſe in reſpect of time it goes before the ſecond. Spirituall death is the ſeparation of the whole man, both in bodie and ſoule, from the gratious and glorious fellowſhip of God. Of theſe two, the firſt is but an entrance to death, and the ſecond is the accompliſhment of it: for as the ſoule is the life of the bodie, ſo God is the life of the ſoule, and his Spirit is the ſoule of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Againe, this ſpirituall death hath three diſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees. The firſt is, when it is aliue in reſpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, and yet it lies dead in ſinne. Of this degree the Apoſtle ſpeakes, when he ſaith, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Shee that liueth in pleaſure is dead while ſhee liueth,</hi> and this is the eſtate of all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who are ſaid to be dead in ſinne.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is in the very end of this life, when
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1365:94"/> the bodie is laid into the earth, then the ſoule deſcends into the place of torments, <note place="margin">Luk. 16.22.23.</note> as the ſoule of the rich man in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the day of Iudgement, when the body and ſoule at the reſurrection of the laſt day meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe and ſhal goe to the place of the damned, there to bee tormented for euer. And this is called by the name of the ſecond death, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> which doth belong onely to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus found the nature, differences, and kinds of death, it is more then manifeſt, that that place of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is to be vnderſtood, not of the ſpirituall death, but of the bodily death, becauſe it is oppoſed to the natiuitie and birth of man. The words then muſt carry this ſence, The time of bodily death, in which there is a ſepara ion of the ſoule of man from the body, either naturall or violent (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called a bodily or worldly death) is better to the childe of God, then the time in which one is borne, and brought into the world.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ſecond point; and that is, how this can bee true which the Preacher ſaith, <hi>That the day of ones death is better then the day of birth.</hi> I make not this queſtion to call the Scriptures into controuerſie, which are the truth it ſelfe, but I doe it to this end and purpoſe, that we might without doubting or wauering bee reſolued of the truth of this, which the Preacher heere auoucheth for the comfort of all the children of God at their death. For there may be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie reaſons brought to the contrary of this, which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher heere auoucheth.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs now handle the queſtions, reaſons, and obiections, which may be alledged to the contrary; which all may be reduced vnto ſixe heads.</p>
               <p>The firſt is taken from the opinion of wiſe men, who thinke it the beſt thing of all neuer to bee borne. And the next, beſt to die quickly as ſoone as he is borne. For <hi>Cicero</hi> an Heathen man, and renowned for his eloquence and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1365:94"/> complaines that nature hath brought man forth into the world, not as a mother, but as a ſtepmother, with a body naked, weake and ſickly, and with a minde diſtracted with cares, deiected with feares, faint with labours, and addicted to luſts and pleaſures; And hence grew this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpeech amongſt the Gentiles related by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> repeated by <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and fathered vpon <hi>Sylemus,</hi> by all three, That the beſt thing in the world was, not to be borne at all, and the next, beſt to die ſooneſt. Now if it be the beſt thing in the world not to be borne at all, then it is the worſt thing that can be, to die after a man is once borne. <hi>Anſw.</hi> There be two ſorts of men, the one that liue and die in their fins; the other, that doe vnfainedly repent, and beleeue in Chriſt, the one goates, the other ſheepe, the one good, the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Now this ſentence and ſpeech of thoſe Heathen men may be truely applied &amp; auouched to the firſt ſort, of whom we may ſay, as our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Iudas.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.24.</note> 
                  <hi>It had beene good for that man that he had neuer beene borne.</hi> But the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to the ſecond ſort, is moſt falſe. For to them that in this life turne to God by true and vnfained repentance, the beſt thing of all is to be borne, becauſe their birth is a degree of preparation vnto all ioy and happineſſe, and the next beſt for them is to die quickly, becauſe by death they doe enter into the poſſeſſion and fruition of the ſame ioy and happineſſe; for their birth is an entrance into it, and their death the accompliſhment of the ſame. And this was the cauſe that made <hi>Baalam</hi> ſo deſirous to die the death of the righteous, and to wiſh that his laſt end might be like theirs. <note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> And therefore in this reſpect the Preacher in this place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the day of death before the day of birth, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby, that death which is ioyned, coupled, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a godly life; and this is called the death of the righteous.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obiection is taken from the teſtimonies of the holy Scriptures, and namely theſe. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20 1. Cor. 15.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>is the wages of ſinne. Death is an enemie of Chriſt.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1365:95"/> Death is the curſe of the Law.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3 13.</note> Hence it ſeemes to follow that in and by death men receiue their wages, and payment for their ſinnes; and ſo thereby the day of death is become the dolefull day, in which the enemie preuailes againſt vs, for that he which dieth is curſed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We muſt diſtinguiſh heere of death: it muſt be conſidered two wayes; firſt, as it is in it ſelfe in his owne nature; ſecondly, as it is altered and changed by the death of Chriſt. Now death by it ſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is indeed the wages of ſinne, the enemie of Chriſt, and of all his members, and the curſe of the law, yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſuburbs and gates of hell, and ſo it is ſtill vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet in the ſecond reſpect it is not ſo; for by the vertue of the death of Chriſt it ceaſeth to bee a plague or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of a curſe is made vnto vs a bleſſing, and become vnto vs a friend, and a paſſage or middle way betweene this life and eternall life; and is become as it were a little wicket, entrance or doore, whereby we paſſe out of this world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen. And then in this reſpect this ſaying of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is moſt true; for in the day of birth men are brought forth and borne into the vale of miſery; but afterward when the children of God goe hence, hauing death altered vnto them by the death of Chriſt, they enter into eternall life and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>The third obiection is taken from the example of moſt worthy men, who (as it ſhould ſeeme) haue made their prayers againſt death, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> as our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We reade when our Sauiour Chriſt was borne, it was a ioyfull time; at whoſe birth there was great ioy and mirth. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2.10.13.28.38. Luke 19.41. Marke 16.10. Luke 23.28.45 Matth. 27.51.</note> yea and the Angels of heauen did ſing, and they bid the Shepheards ſing, becauſe they brought them glad tidings of great ioy, which ſhould be vnto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But when our Sauiour Chriſt ſuffered death, then it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that it was a dolefull time; for then there was as much lamentation and weeping. Our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe wept (whom we reade to haue wept three times, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Ieruſalem, <note place="margin">Iohn 11.35.</note> at the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and in his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1365:95"/> agony) the diſciples wept, the daughters of Ieruſalem wept, <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> the Sunne was darkened, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the ſtones were clouen in ſunder. Yea all theſe and all ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creatures in their kind did weepe and lament the death and paſſion of their maker. And ſo it ſhould ſeeme that our Sauiour Chriſt prayed againſt death on this manner, <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Father if it be thy will, let this cup paſſe from me.</hi> Wee reade alſo that the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed againſt death, <hi>Returne O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>deliuer my ſoule, O ſaue me for thy mercies ſake; for in death there is no remembrance of thee, in the graue who ſhall giue thee thankes?</hi> Againe, <note place="margin">Eſay 38.1.</note> wee reade that King <hi>Ezechiah</hi> prayed againſt death; for when the Prophet brought him word from the Lord, that hee ſhould die and not liue, this good king at this newes wept very ſore, and prayed for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life.</p>
               <p>Now by the examples of theſe moſt worthy men, yea by the example of the Sonne of God himſelfe, it ſhould ſeeme that this ſhould not be true, which the Preacher doth heere auouch, That <hi>the day of death ſhould bee better then the day of birth,</hi> but rather that the day of death ſhould be the moſt dolefull and terrible day of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are heere to vnderſtand, that when our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt prayed in this ſort as we haue heard, he was in his agonie, and he then, as our Redeemer ſtood in our roome and ſtead, to ſuffer and endure all things, which wee our ſelues ſhould haue ſuffered in our own perſons for our ſins, if he himſelfe had not vouchſafed to ſuffer for vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee did not pray ſimply againſt the bodily or naturall death, but againſt the curſed death of the Croſſe; for he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not death it ſelfe, which is the ſeparating of ſoule and bodie, but the curſe of the Law which went with death, as namely, the vnſpeakeable wrath and iudgement of God, which was due for our ſinnes. The firſt death troubled him not, but the firſt and ſecond ioyned together. Therefore the Author to the Hebrewes ſaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he had offered vp prayers and ſupplications with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1365:96"/> ſtrong crying and teares vnto him that was able to ſaue him from death, that he was heard in that he feared.</hi> By which place it appeareth, that Chriſt did not pray ſimply againſt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, but againſt the curſed death of the Croſſe, which was the ſecond death.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Dauids</hi> praying againſt death, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that when he made that ſixt Pſalme, hee was not onely ſicke in bodie, but alſo perplexed with the greateſt temptation of all, in that hee wraſtled in conſcience againſt the wrath of God, as appeares by his owne words. For hee there ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.1.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy anger, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein wee may ſee that he prayed not ſimply againſt death, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt death at that inſtant, when hee was in that grieuous temptation, for at other times he had no ſuch feare of death. And therefore in another Pſalme he ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea though I walke through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I wil feare none ill, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he prayed againſt death onely in that ſixt Pſalm, as it was ioyned with apprehenſion of Gods wrath, as our Sauiour Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, touching king <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> wee are to vnderſtand that he prayed againſt death, not onely becauſe hee deſired to liue, and to doe ſeruice to God in his kingdome, but alſo it was vpon a further and more ſpecial regard, becauſe when the Prophet brought him this meſſage of death he was then without iſſue, hauing none of his owne body to ſucceede him in his kingdome.</p>
               <p>But then it wil be obiected, What warrant he had to pray againſt death for this cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> His warrant was good; for God had made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promiſe vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> and his poſteritie after him, <note place="margin">1. King. 2.4.</note> that as long as they feared him, and walked in his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, there ſhal not faile thee (ſaith he) a man on the throne of Iſrael. Now this good king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> at the time of the Prophets meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of death, remembring what promiſe God had made to <hi>Dauid</hi> and to his ſeed, and how that he for his part in ſome
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1365:96"/> poore and weake meaſure had kept the condition, in that he had walked before God with an vpright heart, and had done that which was well pleaſing and acceptable in his ſight, as he himſelfe ſaith in the ſame place; <note place="margin">Iſay 38 3.</note> therefore hee prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt death, not for that he feared it, but he deſired to haue iſſue of his own to ſucceed him according to the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to his ſeruant <hi>Dauid.</hi> Which prayer of his was ſo well accepted of God, that hee gaue him his requeſt, and added vnto his daies fifteene yeeres; and three yeeres after God gaue him <hi>Manaſſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſay 38.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, beſide theſe examples it will be further obiected, that the godly haue feared death, <note place="margin">1. Kings 19.30.</note> or eſſe why did <hi>Eliah</hi> flie from it in the perſecution of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and Chriſt teach his to flie it in the perſecutions of men: <note place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> and Chriſt himſelfe (as we haue alreadie heard) did pray againſt the bitter cup of it in his agonie, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> and before his apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe Saints did not, nor were to flie from death as it is the end of life, and a moſt bleſſed end of a good life, but vſed the meanes of flight onely to preuent violent and haſtie death till the houre appointed ſhould come, that they were to giue their ſpirit in peace into the hands of him that made it; and becauſe ſuch vntimely death was enemy to the good they had to doe, and courſe they were to finiſh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went aſide by flying for ſome time, and till the time of their departure come, that they might doe the good to which they were appointed, and finiſh the courſe for which they were ſent. For if a remouing or flying for thine eaſe in this reſpect may be effected by ſhifting thy place, that may both be deſired and vſed without ſinne. <hi>Iſaak</hi> ſent his ſonne <hi>Iacob</hi> away from his brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi> in his anger, had ſworne to ſlay him: <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from the hand and iauelin of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſhifted for himſelfe by remouing from place to place, and conuayed all his fathers houſe into the land of Moab from <hi>Sauls</hi> reach. The Lord Ieſus often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdrew himſelfe from the rage of the Iewes, and he gaue his Diſciples a rule for times of perſecution, ſaying,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1365:97"/> 
                  <hi>When they perſecute you in this city,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>flie into another.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny honeſt men haue remooued their habitations to auoide euill neighbours, and free themſelues from beeing troubled by hem.</p>
               <p>But where it is againe alledged that Chriſt himſelfe prayed againſt the cup of death; for the further ſatisfying of this point, I anſwere further two wayes: Firſt, that hee prayed without ſinne againſt it, ſeeing that in his ſupplication of teares, and much feare hee ſubmitted to his Fathers will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.42.</note> 
                  <hi>Neuertheleſſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And againe, <hi>O my Father, if this cup may not paſſe away from me, except I drinke it, thy will be done.</hi> Alſo death was not to him as it is to vs; for to vs the ſting of it is conquered, and the force broken, but to him it was in full power, he felt the ſting of it, and wraſtled with the force of it in ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Secondly I ſay (as was ſaid before) that it was not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bodily death (though vnſubdued, ſaue where himſelfe ſubdued it) that he trembled at, but by the burthen of our ſinnes, which he was to vndergoe, in which hee beheld the whole. There he ſaw his Fathers countenance turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and there knew that he muſt beare his wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he bare our ſinnes. And beſides, Chriſt feared death, beeing cloathed with our fleſh, to ſhew that he tooke our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, <note place="margin">Iſay. 53.4,5,6.</note> and bore our ſorrowes, and was perfect man.</p>
               <p>And ſo death may in ſome caſe be feared, and at ſometime prayed againſt; but euer vnder the correction of Gods will. For the rod of death turned into a ſerpent, made <hi>Moiſes</hi> feare; <note place="margin">Exod. 4.3.</note> and the beſt haue moderately declined and ſhrunke at the ſtroke of death, when it came in ſome tempeſt; and who doth not dread all Gods terrors, whereof death is one, and feare that which is the puniſhment of ſinne, and curſe of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and decline that, which is the ruine and deſtruction of humane nature, and ſhrinke at that which hath made the ſtrongeſt, the wiſeſt, the greateſt, the richeſt to fall downe flat before it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the feare of death thus reproued, is not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1365:97"/> feare of it, which is in all, but the ſeruile feare of it proper to euill doers, and common to thoſe who can haue no hope in death, becauſe they neuer cared to liue, till they were compelled to die.</p>
               <p>The fourth obiection is, that thoſe who haue beene repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of the better ſort of men, haue oftentimes miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ends; for ſome end their dayes deſpayring, ſome rauing and blaſpheming, ſome ſtrangely tormented. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeme that the day of death is the day of greateſt woe and miſerie.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer firſt of all generally, that wee muſt not iudge of the eſtate of any man before God by outward things, whether they be bleſſings or iudgements, whether they fall in life or in death. For as the Preacher ſaith, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>No man knoweth either loue or hatred by all things that are before them; all things come alike to all, and the ſame condition is to the iuſt and to the wicked, and to the good and pure, and to the polluted, and to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not; as is the good, ſo is the ſinner; he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Againe the Preacher ſaith, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.14.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a vanity that is done vpon the earth, that there be iuſt men to whom it hapneth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the work of the wicked, and there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the worke of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwere to the particulars which be alleaged, in this manner; Firſt for deſpaire: it is true, that not onely wicked and looſe perſons deſpaire in death, but alſo godly and penitent ſinners, who often in their ſickneſſe teſtifie of themſelues, that beeing aliue and lying in their beds, they feele themſelues to bee as it were in hell, and to apprehend the very pangs and torments of it; and I doubt not for all this, but that the child of God which is moſt deare vnto him, may through the gulfe of deſperation attaine to euerlaſting life and happineſſe. Which appeares to bee ſo by Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the matter of our ſaluation: For all the workes of God are done in and by their contraries. In the creation all things were made not of ſomething, but of nothing, cleane
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1365:98"/> contrary to the courſe of nature: In the worke of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God giues life not by life, but by death. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider aright of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, wee ſhall ſee our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe out of paradiſe, in the midſt of hell; for out of his own curſed death, hee brings vs a bleſſed life, and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. Likewiſe in our effectuall vocation, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to conuert and turne men vnto him, he doth it by the meanes of the preaching of the Goſpel, which in reaſon ſhould driue men from God, for it is as contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as fire to water, and light to darkneſſe. For the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.21.22.23.52.</note> 
                  <hi>After that in the wiſdome of God, the world by wiſedome knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſaue them that beleeue. For the Iewes require a ſigne, and the Greekes ſeeke after wiſdome; but we preach Chriſt crucified, vnto the Iewes a ſtumbling block, and vnto the Greekes fooliſhneſſe.</hi> And yet for all this, though it be thus againſt the nature and diſpoſition of man, it preuailes with him at length, and turnes him vnto his God, it hee belong vnto him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when God will ſend his owne ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, he ſends ſome of them a contrary way, euen as it were by the gates of hell. For our way to heauen is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, euen as the Lord led the Iſraelites out of Egypt into the Land of Canaan, not through the Land of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtims, <note place="margin">Exod. 13.17.18</note> although that were neere, <hi>For God ſiad leſt peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the people repent, when they ſee warre, and returne to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but God led the people about thorow the way of the wilderneſſe of the red ſea. So God for many cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe, doth bring his children out of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian world vnto the ſpiriutall Canaan, which is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen; not the neereſt way, but by many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and turnings, and the furtheſt way about, euen as it were thorow the red ſea of miſeries and afflictions, that all Gods waues and billowes may goe ouer them.<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord can (if he pleaſe) bring them, as he doth many other of his children, the neereſt way to heauen, but this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1365:98"/> further way about is for Gods owne glorie, and for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens owne good. And God as a moſt wiſe Father, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer kiſſing his childe, but many times correcting him: and the ſame God that doth mercifully exalt vs, by giuing vs a ſweete taſte, and liuely feeling of his grace, and the efficacie of it in vs, doth in much loue many times for our health humble vs, when hee leaues vs without that ſence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our ſelues, and then doth he cure vs of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe of pride, and confidence in our ſelues, ſettle in vs a true foundation of humilitie, cauſe vs to deny our ſelues and depend wholly vpon him, to caſt our ſelues into the armes of his mercie, to hunger for his grace, to pray more zealouſly and with greater feeling of our wants, and to ſet an high price vpon the ſence of Gods fauour, to make more eſteeme of it when we haue it againe, and to kill and mortifie ſome ſpecial ſinne, for which before we had not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and heartily repented. For when it is his good will and pleaſure to make men depend on his fauour and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hee maketh them firſt to feele his anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to be nothing in themſelues, to the end they might value and prize their vocation and calling at an higher rate and eſtimate, and wholly and altogether rely and depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and be whatſoeuer they are, in him only.</p>
               <p>This point being then well weighed and conſidered, it is more then manifeſt, that the child of God may paſſe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euen thorow the very depth and gulfe of hell. For the loue, fauour, and mercie of God is like to a ſea, into which, when a man is caſt, he neither feeles bottom, nor ſees banke: <hi>For thy mercy</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>is great aboue the heauens,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 108.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy truth reacheth vnto the clouds.</hi> So that touching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, whether it ariſeth of the weakneſſe of nature, or of the conſcience of ſinne, though it fall out about the time of death, it can be but the voice and opinion of their ſickneſſe; and a ſicke-mans iudgement of himſelfe, at ſuch time, is not to be regarded; and beſides, it cannot preiudize the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſoules, that are effectually called: <hi>For the gifts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1365:99"/> and calling of God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are without repentance;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.29.</note> and thoſe whom God loueth, hee loueth to the end, and world without end. And as for other ſtrange euents which fall out in death, they are the effects of diſeaſes. Rauings, blaſphemies and idle ſpeeches ariſe of the diſeaſe of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and phrenſies, which often happen at the end of hot burning feauers, the choler ſhooting vp to the braine; the writhing of the lips, turning of the necke, and buckling of the ioynts and the whole body, proceed of crampes and convulſions, which follow after much euacuation; and whereas ſome in ſickneſſe are of that ſtrength, that three or foure can hardly hold them without bonds; it comes not alwayes of witchcraft, as people commonly thinke, but of choler in the veines; and whereas ſome when they are dead, become as blacke as pitch, it may riſe by a bruiſe or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, or by the blacke Iaundiſe, or the putrefaction of the liuer, and doth not alwayes argue ſome extraordinary iudgement of God; in the wicked it doth, but in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not.</p>
               <p>Now theſe and the like diſeaſes with their ſymptomes, and ſtrange effects, though they doe depriue man of his health, and of the right vſe of the parts of his bodie, and the vſe of reaſon and vnderſtanding, yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue his ſoule of eternal life and happineſſe, which with the ſoule of <hi>Dauid</hi> is bound vp in the bundle of life, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.29.</note> with the Lord his God in eternall peace and bleſſedneſſe. And all ſins procured by theſe violent and ſharpe diſeaſes, proceeding from repentant ſinners, are ſins only of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which if they knew them, and came againe to the vſe of reaſon and vnderſtanding, they will further repent, if not, yet they are pardoned and buried in the bloud of Chriſt, and in his death, who is their Sauiour and great Biſhoppe of their ſoules; <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.24.25.</note> for he that forgiueth the greater ſinnes, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in his children forgiue the leſſe. And againe, wee ought not to ſtand ſo much vpon the ſtrangeneſſe of any mans end, when we knew before the goodneſſe of his conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1365:99"/> and life. For wee muſt iudge a man in this caſe, not by his vnquiet death, but by his former quiet godly life.</p>
               <p>And if this bee true that ſtrange diſeaſes, and thereupon very ſtrange behauiour in death may befall the beſt childe of God, we muſt then learne to reforme our iudgements of ſuch as lye thus at the point of death.</p>
               <p>The common opinion is, if a man lye quietly in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and goe away like a lambe (which in ſome diſeaſes, as in conſumptions and ſuch like lingring diſeaſes, any man may doe) that then he goes ſtraight-way to heauen, though he haue liued neuer ſo wickedly. But if the violence of the diſeaſe ſtirre vp impatiencie, and cauſe in the partie frantick and vnſeemely behauiour, then men vſe to ſay, though hee be neuer ſo godly, that there is a iudgement of God, ſeruing either to diſcouer an Hypocrite, or to plague a wicked man. But the truth is farre otherwiſe, for in truth one may die like a lambe, and yet goe to hell. For the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <note place="margin">Pſal. 7 3.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>There are no bonds in their death, but their ſtrength is firme, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued as other men.</hi> And againe, another dying in exceeding torments and ſtrange behauiour of the body, may goe to heauen; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof we haue in that holy and iuſt man <hi>Iob,</hi> as may appeare throughout his whole booke; and in diuers others Gods deare Saints and children. Therefore by theſe ſtrange and violent kinds of ſickneſſe and death, which doe many times happen to the deare Saints of God: wee muſt take great heed that wee iudge not raſhly of them in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to be wicked and notorious Hypocrites and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; for it may be our owne cafe for ought wee know. This raſh cenſuring and iudging, was the ſinne of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Barbarians, as we may reade in the Acts of the Apoſtles. <note place="margin">Act. 28.3 4.5.6</note> This raſh cenſuring and iudging, was alſo the ſinne of the wicked Iewes, as we may reade in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.1.2.3.4.5.</note> wherein they did vtter a ſecret corruption, naturally ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all men, that is, very ſharpely to ſee into the ſinnes of others, and ſeuerely to cenſure them; but in the meane
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1365:100"/> time to flatter themſelues, and be blind-fold in ſeeing their owne; for theſe men thought, becauſe the like iudgements did not fall on themſelues, that therefore they were ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and not ſo great ſinners, but rather highly in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of God; euen as many in the world doe now adaies falſely imagine and ſuppoſe that they are alwayes the worſt ſort of people, whom God doth moſt ſtrike and preſſe with his puniſhing hand; hauing forgotten that God doth not keepe an ordinary rate heere below, to puniſh euery man as he is worſt, or to cocker and fauour him as he is beſt; but onely taketh ſome example as hee thinketh good for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and aduertiſement of others, and to be as it were looking-glaſſes, wherein euery man may ſee his owne face, yea, and his owne cauſe handled, and that God is a ſeuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger of ſinne, that all men may learne by the example of ſome to tremble and beware, leſt they bee conſtrained in their owne turnes to know and feele the puniſhment they haue deſerued. Whereupon our Sauiour Chriſt is iuſtly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to correct their erroneous and ſiniſter iudgement, and to teach them that they muſt not reioyce at the iuſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others. For this is the propertie of the wicked, as appeareth in the book of the Lamentations, where it is ſaid, <hi>All mine enemies haue heard of my trouble,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 1.21:</note> 
                  <hi>they are glad that thou haſt done it; but he that is glad</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe-man) <hi>at calamities,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall not be vnpuniſhed:</hi> but he ſhould rather be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thereby to repent. And to all ſuch barbarous, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and vncharitable cenſurers of the children of God, the Lord by his Prophet ſaith, <hi>Loe, I begin to bring euill vpon the Citie which is called by my name,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 25.29.</note>

                  <hi>Yee ſhall not be vnpuniſhed.</hi> And againe, <hi>Behold, they whoſe iudgement was not to drinke of the cup, haue aſſuredly drunken; and art thou he thou he that ſhalt goe altogether vnpuniſhed? Thou ſhalt not goe vnpuniſhed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>but ſhalt ſurely drinke of it.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The time is come, that iudgement muſt begin at the houſe of God: And if it firſt begin at vs, what ſhall the end be of them that obay not the Goſpell of God?</hi> Therefore iudge
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1365:100"/> not thus raſhly of thoſe that are thus grieuouſly handled in this manner, but think thy ſelfe as bad a ſinner, if not worſe, and that the like defects may befall thee, and thinke ſome great temptation befell them, and that thy ſelfe ſhouldeſt be worſe, if the like temptation ſhould befall thee, and giue God thankes that as yet the like hath not happened vnto thee.</p>
               <p>The fift obiection is this: When a man is moſt neere death, then the deuill is moſt buſie in temptation; and the more man is aſſaulted by Sathan, the more dangerous is his caſe; and therefore it may ſeeme that the day of death is the worſt day of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The condition of Gods children in earth is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; ſome are not tempted, and otherſome are. Some are not tempted (I ſay) as <hi>Simeon,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 2.29,30.</note> who (as we read in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of S. <hi>Luke</hi>) when he had ſeene his Sauiour Chriſt, brake foorth into theſe words: <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſeruant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes haue ſeene thy ſaluation:</hi> foreſignifying no doubt, that hee ſhould end his dayes in all maner of peace: And as <hi>Abraham;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15.15.</note> 
                  <hi>For thou ſhalt goe</hi> (as God ſaid vnto him) <hi>vnto thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.</hi> And as <hi>Ioſiah</hi> that good king. <hi>Behold therefore</hi> (ſaith the Lord vnto him) I wil gather thee vnto thy fathers, <note place="margin">2. Kings 22.20.</note> and thou ſhalt be gathered vnto thy graue in peace, and thine eyes ſhall not ſee all the euill which I will bring vpon this place.</p>
               <p>And as for them that are tempted (as diuers of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are ſubiect thereunto) though their caſe be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, yet their ſaluation is not the further off; for God is then more ſpecially preſent by the vnſpeakable comfort of his holy Spirit; and when we are moſt weake, he is moſt ſtrong in vs, becauſe his maner is to ſhew his power in our weakneſſe. An example whereof we haue in the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who was greatly aſſaulted and tempted by Sathan. <hi>And leſt I ſhould</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be exalted aboue meaſure,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.7,8,9.</note> 
                  <hi>through the abundance of the reuelation, there was giuen to me a thorne
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1365:101"/> in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Sathan to buffet me, leſt I ſhould bee exalted aboue meaſure. For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me, and hee ſaid vnto mee my grace is ſufficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſſe.</hi> And for this cauſe euen in the time of death, the deuill receiueth the greateſt foile, when he lookes for the greateſt victory.</p>
               <p>The ſixt and laſt obiection is this: that violent and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den death is a grieuous curſe, and of all euils which befall in this life, none is ſo terrible, therefore it may ſeeme that the day of ſuch a kind of death is moſt miſerable.</p>
               <p>I anſwere: It is true indeed, that ſuch death as is ſudden, is a curſe and grieuous iudgement of God; and therfore not without good cauſe feared of men in this world. Yet all things conſidered, we ought to be more afraid of an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and euill life, then of ſudden death. For though it be euill as death it ſelfe in it owne nature, is, yet wee muſt not thinke it to be ſimply euill, becauſe it is not euill to all men, nor in all reſpects euill: I ſay, it is not euill to all men, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that no kind of death is euill, or a curſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vnto them that are ingrafted in Chriſt, for that they are free in him from the whole curſe of the lawe. <note place="margin">Reu. 14.13:</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they</hi> (ſaith the Sonne of God) <hi>that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and their workes follow them.</hi> Whereby it is ſignified that they which depart this life, (being members of Chriſt Ieſus, of what death ſoeuer they die, yea though their death be neuer ſo ſudden and violent) doe enter into euerlaſting ioy and felicitie. <note place="margin">Pſal. 116.15.</note> Againe, <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>is the death of his Saints.</hi> Their death therefore (be it neuer ſo ſudden or otherwiſe) muſt needes be precious; yea, though death commeth vpon the children of God neuer ſo ſharpely, <note place="margin">Prou. 14.32.</note> and ſuddenly, yet <hi>the righteous</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe man) <hi>hath hope in his death.</hi> Againe, that ſudden death is not euill in all reſpects, is apparant. For it is not euill becauſe it is ſudden, but commonly it takes men vnprepared, and therefore euill, and ſo makes the day of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1365:101"/> death a blacke day, and as it were a ſpeedie downefall to the gulfe of hell; otherwiſe if a man be readie and prepared to die (as he ought alwaies to bee) then ſudden death is in effect no death, but a quicke, eaſie, and ſpeedie paſſage and entrance vnto eternall life and happineſſe. For why ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou, being the child of God vnwillingly ſuffer a ſhort death, that will bring thee to the fruition of life eternall, and all happineſſe? Rather perſwade thy ſelfe that if thou liue in the feare of God thou ſhalt doe well, and ſo liuing, though thou die neuer ſo ſuddenly thou ſhalt doe better; and that the worſt hurt that ſudden death can doe thee (if this may be called hurt) is to ſend thee but a little ſooner then (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture) thy fraile fleſh would be willing, <note place="margin">Ioh. 14.2.3.</note> to thy Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who is gone but a little before thee, through great and manifold dangers and temptations, to prepare a place (as he himſelfe ſaith) for thee, and to receiue thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, that where he is, there thou mayeſt be alſo; and remember that that worſt is thy beſt hope. The worſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſudden death is rather a helpe then a harme.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe obiections being thus anſwered at large, it doth appeare plainly to be a manifeſt truth, which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher here ſaith, <hi>That the day of death is better then the day of ones birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to the third point, in which the reaſons and reſpects are to be conſidered, that make the day of death to ſurpaſſe the day of ones birth; and they may all be reduced to this one, namely, that the birth day is an entrance into all woe and miſerie; whereas the day of death ioyned and accompanied with a godly and reformed life, is an entrance and degree to eternall life and glory. Which appeareth thus: <hi>viz.</hi> Eternall life hath three degrees; one in this life, and that is, when a man can truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt, neuertheleſſe I liue; yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in mee.</hi> And this all ſuch can ſay, as truely repent and beleeue, and that are iuſtified, ſanctified, and haue the peace of a good conſcience, and are furniſhed with the giftes and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1365:102"/> graces of Gods holy Spirit, which is the earneſt of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is in the end of this life, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die goes to the earth from whence it came, and the ſoule returnes to God that gaue it.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the end of this world at the laſt iudgement, when bodie and ſoule being re-vnited, do ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Now of theſe three degrees, death it ſelfe (being coupled with the feare of God) is the ſecond, in as much as death is as it were the hand of God, to ſort and ſingle out all thoſe that are the ſeruants of God, from amongſt the wicked of this wretched world. So that death is a freedome from all miſeries, which haue their end in death; and which is the firſt benefit that comes by death, and the firſt ſtep to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and glory. And the ſecond benefit that comes by death, is, that it giues an entrance to the ſoule, and makes way for it, and doth (as it were) vſher it into the glorious preſence of the euerlaſting God, of Chriſt, of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the reſt of Gods Saints in heauen. And this is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table comfort againſt death; for as all other euils of paine, are to a godly Chriſtian changed into another nature, and of puniſhments are become fauours, and benefits; ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this of death; for now it is not a token of Gods wrath for ſinne, but an argument of his loue, mercie, and fauour to his children. It is not properly death, but as it were a bridge by which we paſſe to a better life; from corruption to incorruption, from mortalitie to immortalitie, from earth to heauen; that is in a word, from vanity and miſerie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy and felicitie, and a way thereby made for the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Now who would not willingly paſſe ouer this bridge that is ſo eaſie, whereby he goeth from all cares and ſorrowes, to all delight and pleaſure, leauing all miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and hauing all contentation and happineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>The gentiles taking it for granted, that either after death
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1365:102"/> we ſhould be happie, or not be at all, concluded that at leaſt death would free vs from all euill and miſerie, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did willingly embrace death, as a rich treaſure. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians alſo builded gorgeous Sepulchres, but meane hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe the one was to them but an Inne, the other, as they did thinke, an eternall habitation, which freed them from all miſery. And <hi>Seneca</hi> again exclaimes, that our whole life is a penance, which the <hi>Thracians</hi> confirmed by their practiſe, celebrating their childrens birth with weeping and lamentation, but their death with great ioy and mirth, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ancient Writers record; whereby inſinuating, that our life is nothing but miſerie, and death the end of miſerie. But they haue beene all greatly miſtaken therin, for it is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chriſtian only which enioyeth theſe benefits by death, as namely the exemption and freedome from all cares, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and miſeries. For which cauſe the death of the godly is called in the Scriptures by the names of Bed and Peace. <note place="margin">Eſay 57.2.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds</hi> (ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet). It is called by the name of Reſt, <note place="margin">Reu. 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall reſt from their labours</hi> (ſaith the Sonne of God.) And the Author to the Hebrewes ſaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>There remaineth therefore a reſt to the people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the Scripture entitles death by the name of ſleep, and ſpeaketh of the dead, as of ſuch as are aſleepe; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <note place="margin">Dan. 12.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Many of them that ſleepe in the dust of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to euerlaſting life, and ſome to euerlaſting ſhame and contempt.</hi> And our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaking of <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter which was dead, ſeeing all the people weepe and lament her, ſaid vnto them, <hi>Weepe not,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 8.52.</note>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1365:103"/> deepe ſleepe by the Phyſitian, and asked how hee did, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Rectè, nam frater fratrem amplectitur,</hi> Well, (quoth he) for one brother embraceth another. The like is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of <hi>Gorgias Leontinus:</hi> and the Poet ſaith, Sleepe is the kinſman of death: <hi>Quid eſt ſomnus</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>niſi breuis mors,</hi> What is ſleepe but a ſhort death? <hi>Et quid eſt mors niſi longus ſomnus,</hi> What is death but a long ſleepe?</p>
               <p>By beds, the Scripture vnderſtandeth the places, where the Lord beſtoweth the bodies of his ſeruants after their death, whether fire or water, or the paunches of wild beaſts, or the chambers of the earth, ſea, or ayre; and theſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led beds, becauſe they ſhall reſt quietly in them, as in their beds, till the morning bell, or loud trumpet of the laſt great day, warning all fleſh to riſe, ſhall raiſe them. And therefore it is ſuch an vſuall thing in the Scriptures, ſo ſoone as men dye to ſay they fall aſleep, becauſe therby is meant that they are laid in their beds of peace; and they are called beds of reſt, to put difference betweene theſe beds of our nights ſleepe and thoſe of our ſleepe in death: for heere be our beds neuer ſo ſoft or well made, we often take no reſt, by reaſon of ſome diſtemper in our bodies, or fancies in our head; but in theſe ſleeping places, <note place="margin">Pſal. 4.8.</note> which are called beds of reſt, wee may <hi>lay vs downe</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and ſleepe in peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord our life being our keeper, will make vs dwell in ſafetie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed in it owne nature, the graue is rather an houſe of perdition, then a bed of reſt; but being altered to the Iewes in promiſe, to vs in performance, by Chriſts graue, who was buried in the earth, to change the nature of it, it is made to vs a chamber of reſt, and bed of downe.</p>
               <p>Theſe titles which are thus giuen vnto death, is a ſweete comfort to the children of God againſt the terrors of death, for the graues of the righteous, which by nature are the houſes of deſtruction, and chambers of feare, are by Chriſt and the graue of Chriſt made vnto them chambers of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and beds of reſt. Chriſt by his buriall hath conſecrated
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1365:103"/> and perfumed our graues, making them which were priſons to hell, gates to heauen. At night we take our chambers, and lye downe in our beds, ſo when death comes (which is the end of life, as the night is of the day) we goe to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the earth, and there lye downe in our beds, till the day of refreſhing (which is the day of riſing) come, that commeth from the Lord.</p>
               <p>This is a confutation of that phanſie, that hath ſo long deluded the ſimple world, which is, that dead bodies walke after their death, and appeare vnto men. For how can that be, when the bodies of Gods children reſt in their beds, ſo ſoone as the breath departeth, and the bodies of the wicked are in their priſons, till the day of aſſiſe. Whereof, if any make a queſtion, let him open their graues, and ſee. And ſeeing the ſoule returneth not, after it hath left the body, how can the body walke that wanteth a ſoule, or the ſoule be ſeene, if it ſhould walke, which hath no bodie? <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> or if death be a looſing of our ſoules from our bodies, how can there be any death, when ſoule and body are not parted, and when the man is not dead, but liueth.</p>
               <p>But this phanſie came from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and is but a Philoſophers dreame, told by him to the world, which was that the ſoules of men departed, did enter into the bodies of other men, good ſoules into good, and bad into bad mens bodies. The world then beleeued him; and ſince that time Satan, who can turne himſelfe into all formes, did in the dark night of Popery (to deceiue that ignorant age) change himſelfe into the ſimilitude of ſome perſon, that was lately, or had beene long dead, and was beleeued by ſuch a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be the partie, man or woman, that hee reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. So entred the error, that ſpirits did walke, and that dead bodies came out of their graues, and haunted ſundry houſes in the night, which were not the bodies of the dead, but the Diuell in thoſe bodies or ſhapes, as it is to be ſeene in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> counterfeit ſhape, raiſed by the Witch at Endor. <note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.14.15.</note> And this error, as it deceiued the blinde world, and ſomewhat
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1365:104"/> troubled the ſeeing, <note place="margin">Mat. 14.26.</note> ſo is it ſtill in the mouth and faith of credulous ſuperſtition at this day. But God hauing giuen eyes to vs to ſee his truth, <note place="margin">Act. 12.15.</note> and the light of iudgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it: let vs not walke in ſo great darkneſſe, as they that know not the truth, nor whither they goe. But the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drift of the holy Ghoſt in the holy Scripture, by entitling death by the names of bed, of peace, of reſt, of ſleepe and ſuch like (being all names of ſinguler commoditie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit) is for the ſinguler comfort of all Gods children, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto them thereby, that they ſhal feele no bitterneſſe in death, but rather ioy, and reioyce in their deliue ance, as if they were going to their beds, and their liues are not loſt, but their bodies ſleepe, as in a bed, moſt ſweetely, vntill the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>How ſweete is peace to them which haue bin long trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with warres and tedious contentions; how pleaſant is the bed, reſt and ſleepe, to them that haue ouerwatched themſelues. The Laborer is glad when his taske is done, the traueller reioyceth when he commeth to the end of his iourney, the Mariner is happie, when after a dangerous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age he arriueth in his harbour. All men ſhunne paine, and deſire eaſe, abhorre danger, and loue ſecuritie. It were mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then for a godly Chriſtian to feare ſo aduantagious a death, and to wiſh for continuance of ſuch a wretched life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath a moſt excellent and elegant ſaying. That (ſaith he) is not to be feared, which ſets vs free from all that is to be feared, and that is death, which putteth an end to all feares and miſeries. But the true Chriſtian hath yet a farre greater benefit by death, for it doth not only put an end to euils of paine, but alſo to the euils of faults, not onely to the puniſhment for ſinne, but to ſinne it ſelfe. Now the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils of faults are farre worſe then the euils of paine; yea the leaſt ſinne is more to be hated, abhorred and ſhunned, then the greateſt puniſhment for ſinne. How comfortable then and welcome ſhould death be vnto vs, that endeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſorrowes, but alſo our ſinnes.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1365:104"/>
               <p>As long as we liue heere, and beare about vs theſe earthly and ſinfull tabernacles, we daily multiplie our tranſgreſſions and rebellions againſt our gratious God, and ſuſtaine fierie conflicts and continuall combates in our very boſomes. O bondage of all bondages, to be in bondage vnto ſinne!</p>
               <p>The Gentile that apprehended vice only as a morall euil, could ſay that men being in bondage to their luſtes, were more cruelly handled by them, then any ſlaues were by moſt cruell tyrants and monſters; how much more then ſhould we that feele ſinne as a ſpirituall euill, and groane vnder the burthen therof, account that bondage more intollerable, and worſe ſubiection, then can bee to the moſt barbarous and cruell tyrant in the world, from whoſe tyrannie hee that ſhould ſet vs free, muſt needs bee welcome. Which death, and onely death can doe. What great cauſe haue we then with all willingneſſe to embrace death, and be greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted when it appproacheth?</p>
               <p>But death do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h yet much more for vs, then all this; for it not onely frees vs from all euills, euen ſinne, but puts vs alſo into actuall and peaceable poſſeſſion of all good things, and bringeth vs to that good place, where (if there were any place for any paſſion) we would be offended with Death for not bringing vs thither long before. And though the bodie rotte in the graue, or bee eaten of wormes, or deuoured by beaſts or ſwallowed vp by fiſhes, or burnt to aſhes, yet that will not be to vs a matter of diſcomfort, not-onely becauſe (as wee haue heard before) they are at reſt and doe ſleepe in peace in their beddes till the laſt day, but alſo (if wee doe well conſider the ground of all grace) as namely our vnion and coniunction with Chriſt our head) it is indeede a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and yet moſt real coniunction and vnion. For we muſt not imagine that our ſoules alone are ioyned and vnited to the body or ſoule of Chriſt, but the whole parſon of man both body and ſoule, is vnited and conioyned to whole Chriſt. For we are vnited wholy to whole Chriſt (who is not deuided) euen according to both natures, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.13. 1. Cor.3.21.</note> by which hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1365:105"/> is wholy oure; but after this good order, as firſt to be vnited to the manhood, and then by the manhood vnto the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt. And when we are once ioyned and vnited to whole Chriſt in this mortall life by the bond of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we ſhal ſo abide and remaine eternally ioyned and vnited vnto him. And this coniunction and vnion being once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, can never afterward be diſſolued.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes that although the bodie bee ſeuered from the ſoule by death, yet neither the ſoule nor body are ſeuered or ſundred from Chriſt, but the very bodie rotting in the graue, or howſoeuer elſe conſumed, abide ſtill ioyned and vnited vnto Chriſt, and is then as truly a member of Chriſt, as it was before death. For looke what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chriſt in death, the ſame or the like is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his members. Now the condition of Chriſt was this; though his body and ſoule were ſeuered and ſundered for the time the one from the other, as farre as heauen and the graue, yet neither of them were ſundered from the God-head of the Sonne, but both did in his Death ſubſiſt in his perſon. Euen ſo though our bodies and ſoules bee pulled in ſunder by naturall or violent death, yet neither of them, no not the body it ſelfe ſhalbe pulled or diſioyned from Chriſt the head; but by the vertue of this coniunction and vnion ſhall the dead body (howſoeuer it bee waſted and conſumed) ariſe at the laſt day to eternall glory. For although the dead bodies of Gods Saints are often mingled with the bodies of beaſts, foules, fiſhes or other creatures that deuoure them; yet as the Goldſmith by his art can feuer mettals, and extract one met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall out of another: euen ſo God can and will diſtinguiſh theſe duſts of his Saints at the laſt day of the glorious reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p>In the winter ſeaſon the trees remaine without fruit or leaues, and being beaten with the winde and weather, they appeare to the eye and view of all men, as if they were withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and rotten dead trees; yet when the ſpring time comes, they become aliue againe, and (as before) doe bring forth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1365:105"/> their buds, bloſſoms, leaues, and fruits; the reaſon is becauſe the body, grayne and armes of the tree, are all ioyned and faſtened to the roote, where all the ſappe and moiſture lies in the winter time, and from thence by reaſon of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction it is deriued in the ſpring to all the parts of the tree.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo the bodies of men haue their winter alſo, and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in death, in which time they are turned into duſt, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for a time dead and rotten. Yet in the ſpring time, that is at the laſt day at the reſurrection, by meanes of the miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call coniunction and vnion with Chriſt, his diuine &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vertue ſhall ſtreame and flow from thence to all the bodies of his elect and choſen members, and cauſe them to liue againe, and that to life eternall. For the bodies of Gods elect being the members of Chriſt, though they be neuer ſo much rotten, putrified and conſumed, yet are they ſtill in Gods fauour, and in the couenant of grace, to which, becauſe they haue right, being dead, they ſhall not remaine ſo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in their graues, but ſhall ariſe againe at the laſt day vnto glory. And by reaſon of this vnion and coniunction with Chriſt, we gaine the prayers of the Saints yet liuing with vs, the loue of the Saints glorified before vs, the miniſtrie of Angels working for vs, grace in earth, and glory in heauen. And in Chriſt, our gaine is ſuch, as that we ſhall haue all loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes recompenced, all wants ſupplied, all curſes remoued, all croſſes ſanctified, all graces increaſed, all hopes confirmed, all promiſes performed, all bleſſedneſſe procured, Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, death deſtroyed, the graue ſweetened, corruption aboliſhed, ſanctification perfected, and heauen opened for our happy entrance. And as for death it ſelfe, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that it is chiefely ſinne that makes it ſo terrible vnto vs; for in it ſelfe, and by it ſelfe, it is the wages of ſinne, and the reuenging ſcourge of the angry God, but vnto thoſe that beleeue in Chriſt, it is changed into a moſt ſweete ſleepe. For although the regenerate, &amp; thoſe that beleeue in Chriſt, doe as yet carry about the reliques of ſinne in their fleſh, from whence alſo the bodie is dead, that is to ſay, ſubiect to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:1365:106"/> death, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.10.</note> for the ſinne that dwelleth in it, yet the ſpirit is life for righteouſneſſe, that is, becauſe they are iuſtified from ſinne by true faith in Chriſt, and reſiſt the luſts of the fleſh through the Spirit; therefore that ſinne which yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the fleſh, is not imputed vnto them, but is couered with the ſhadow of the grace of God. Therefore by death the true and ſpiritual life of the ſoule doth not die in them, but doth rather begin; to which death is conſtrained to doe (as it were) the office of a midwife. So that now we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from ſinne, in Chriſt, that it cannot hurt vs, nay it is conuerted to our owne profit; and therfore death hauing her ſtrength from ſinne, is not to bee feared, ſith ſinne, the ſting of death, is ouercome. What need wee feare the ſnake that hath loſt her ſting, ſhee can only hiſſe and make a noyſe, but cannot hurt; and therefore wee ſee that many hauing taken out the ſting, will carry the ſnake in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes without any feare. Euen ſo although we cary death about vs in our mortall bodies, yea in our boſomes and bowels, yet ſinne which was her ſting, being pulled out by the death of Chriſt, ſhee can onely hiſſe and make a ſtirre, and ordinarily looke blacke and grimme, but can no wayes annoy vs.</p>
               <p>Which will be the more manifeſt, if we well weigh how Chriſt our head and Captaine hath quelled and conquered this mightie Gyant for vs, whereby none that are Chriſts members need ſtand in feare thereof. <hi>Death</hi> (ſaith the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle) <hi>is ſwallowed vp in victory,</hi> and Chriſt was dead, and now liueth, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.54. Reu. 1.18.</note> and that for euer. <hi>And he hath the keyes of hell and death,</hi> as he teſtifieth of himſelfe in the booke of the Reuelation. Now he that hath the keyes of a place, hath the command of that place. It is as much then as if it had been ſaid, he had the command of death, and power to diſpoſe of it at his pleaſure. And will Chriſt then that hath ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie at his mercie, let him hurt and annoy his deare friends; nay his owne members, and ſo in effect himſelfe? Noe, noe, he conquered death for vs, not for himſelfe, ſeeing death had no quarrell to him.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:1365:106"/>
               <p>By his vniuſt death then, hee hath vanquiſhed our iuſt death, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> very excellently ſaith, Death could not be conquered, but by death, therefore Chriſt ſuffered death, that an vniuſt death might ouercome a iuſt death, and that he might deliuer the guiltie iuſtly, by dying for them vniuſtly. Whereunto agreeth that ſpeech, The vniuſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the iuſt is puniſhed; the guiltie tranſgreſſeth, and the innocent is beaten; the wicked offendeth, and the godly is condemned; that which the euill deſerueth, the good ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth; that which the ſeruant oweth, the maſter payeth; that which man committeth, God ſuſtaineth. For although, becauſe he was man, he could die, and did ſo, yet becauſe he was iuſt, hee ought not to haue died; and hee that had no cauſe to die for himſelfe, in reaſon and equitie ſhould not die for others vnprofitably,; neither did he ſurely, but to the greateſt purpoſe, that the Sonne of God dying for the ſonnes of men, the ſonnes of men might thereby bee made the ſonnes of God; yea that they of bad ſeruants, might bee made good ſonnes. And this glorious myſtery of our Sauiours Incarnation and Paſſion muſt needs bring forth glorious effects: this ſtrange and vnſpeakable loue of God, that his onely Sonne ſhould die for vs, that the Lord ſhould dye for diſobedient ſeruants, the Creator for the creature, God for man, this ſtrange loue (I ſay) muſt needs bee of ſtrange operation, as it is, euen to make of ſinners iuſt men, of ſlaues brethren, of captiues fellow-heires, and of baniſhed perſons Kings, and to make of death, as it were, no death, but a very eaſie paſſage to eternal life: for the death of Chriſt is the death of our death, ſith hee died that wee might liue; and how can it be, but that they ſhould liue, for whom life it ſelfe died?</p>
               <p>Surely Death by vſurping vpon the innocent, forfeited her right to the guiltie, and while ſhee deuoured wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhee her ſelfe was deuoured. Yea in that Chriſt hath van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed death, we may be truely ſaid to vanquiſh it. <note place="margin">Rom. 8.37. Epheſ. 5.30.</note> 
                  <hi>For in this</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we are more then conquerours through
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1365:107"/> him that loued vs,</hi> he being our head and wee his members, and where the head is conqueror, the members cannot bee captiues.</p>
               <p>Let vs then reioyce, that wee haue alreadie ſeized on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in Chriſt, who hath caried our fleſh thither in his owne perſon, as an earneſt peny and pledge of the whole ſumme that in time ſhalbe brought thither. Wee may then boldly ſay, that there is ſomewhat of ours aboue already, yea the beſt part of vs, as namely, our head, from which the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cannot be farre; yea we may aſſure our ſelues, that wee being members of ſuch a head, yea bodie to it, we are in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect where our head is. For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, This bodie cannot be beheaded, but if the head triumph for euer, the members alſo muſt needs triumph for euer.</p>
               <p>And that we haue this benefit by Chriſts aſcenſion into heauen aforehand for vs, <hi>Bernard</hi> excellently ſheweth. Be it (ſaith he) that only Chriſt is entred into heauen, yet I trow, whole Chriſt muſt enter; and if whole Chriſt, then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as well as the head, yea euery particular member of the bodie. For this head is not to be found in the kingdome of heauen without his members.</p>
               <p>In a word, the head being aboue water, the bodie can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be drowned, although it bee neuer ſo much beaten and toſſed in this world with waues and tempeſts. Oh, but life is ſweet and death is fearefull, how then may I bee prepared againſt that houre, to vndergoe it in a Chriſtian patience without earthly paſſions? I anſwer, this is indeed the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of our fleſh, and the propertie of our corrupt nature, that we are more deſirous of this life fading, then of the life to come that is not flitting; and hence comes that feare and terror of death. <note place="margin">Iohn 10.28.</note> Death in it ſelfe, and out of Chriſt is (as we haue heard) very dreadfull, and we haue reaſon to feare it, as it is an effect of ſinne. But we ſpeake not of death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered out of Chriſt, or conſidered in it ſelfe, but of death altered by the death of Chriſt; for ſo it is no dreadful thing, but much to be deſired: he is our Paſtor, we need not feare
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1365:107"/> to be taken out of his hands: our Aduocate, <note place="margin">1. Iohn 2.1. 1. Tim. 2.5. Iohn 8.12. Pſal. 91.1.

Well may the brute beaſts feare to die, whoſe end of life is their end of being: well may the Epicure feare and tremble at death, who with his life looketh to looſe his felicitie: well may the faithleſſe and impenitent ſinner feare and quake, whoſe death is the beginning of their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: well may the voluptuous worldling, (whoſe felicitie conſiſts wholy in the fruition of theſe tranſitorie things) greatly feare death as that which depriueth him of his pomp and preferment, of his honours and high calling, robbeth him of his iewels and treaſure, ſpoileth him of his paſtimes and pleaſures, exileth him from his friends and country, and vtterly bereaueth him of all his expectations, ſolace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.

They apprehend death as a ſtrong enemy, finding in it (through their continuall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe and infidelitie) no likelihood of ſaluation, no ſigne of peace; and therefore it is for them to feare to bee diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to think death to be no other change then a plague, death to them is a beginning of eternall death, and no path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to Chriſt, but a portall-doore to deſtruction, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may iuſtly feare death.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing the Lord hath vouchſafed you a penitent and beleeuing heart, goe on boldly, <note place="margin">Pſal. 116 9:</note> and receiue your portion in

               <p>So now it remaineth that you do as one that hath his houſe on fire, burning all in a flame, that it is vnpoſsible to bee quenched, who will throw out from thence and fetch his treaſures and iewels, that ſo hee may with them build ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houſe; euen ſo muſt you doe: Let your owne ruinous houſe burne, let it periſh, ſeeing it may not bee otherwiſe.

And of the Saints and Martyrs of God in the Primitiue Church in the ten perſecutions, they were thruſt out of their houſes, ſpoiled of their patrimony, loaded with irons, locked vp faſt in priſons and dungeons, burned with fire, beheaded, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and preſſed to death, roſted on ſpits, broiled on gridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, boyled in hot oyle and ſcalding lead, throwne downe from high and ſteepe mountaines vpon ſharpe ſtakes, torne with wilde horſes, rent in ſunder with the violence of bowed trees, condemned to toile in the mettal mines, thruſt thorow with ſpeares, brayned, racked, pricked with pen-kniues, their eyes bored out, their tongues cut out, their bowels ripped out of their bellies, their bodies diſmembred with varitie of puniſhments, ſome whipped to death, others famiſhed to death, ſome ſtabbed in with forkes of iron, ſome drowned in ſackes, ſome their skins plucked off aliue, ſome killed with cold, and left naked to the open ſhame of the world. Cities lay full of dead mens bodies, and the bloud ranne ſtreaming in the ſtreets, their torments were ſo great, that the lookers on were amazed, and they were ſo mangled that the inward veins and arteries appeared, and the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of their bodies ſeene; they were ſet vpon ſharpe ſhels taken out of the ſea; and made to go vpon ſharpe nailes and thornes, and rolled vp and downe in veſſels full of ſharpe nailes, plates of iron were laid red-hot to their arme-pits,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1365:109"/> they were torne and pulled in peeces, ſtrangled in priſons, gnawne with the teeth of cruell ſauage beaſts, toſſed vpon bulles hornes, their bodies were laid in heapes, and dogges left to keep them that none might come to bury them, they were put into beares skins, and baited by dogges, and yet were not diſmaid at any kinde of torment or crueltie; the tormented were more ſtrong then the Tormentors, and their beaten and torne members ouercame the beating ſcourges, and tearing hookes, the tormentors were wearie with tormenting, and being ouercome, were faine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to giue ouer.</p>
               <p>And in truth, what is it that we ſuffer, being compared with their ſufferings? <note place="margin">Heb. 12.4.</note> euen nothing in a manner: <hi>Yee haue not</hi> (ſaith the Author to the Hebrews) <hi>yet reſiſted vnto bloud.</hi> And why then ſhould we feare death in the leaſt degree, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe holy Martyrs and Saints of God feared it not at the higheſt degree? <note place="margin">1.

               <p>Let vs therefore with our whole might arme our ſelues for this combate of death. The perſecuters, when they wound vs moſt, are deepelieſt wounded themſelues, and when they think moſt of all to be conquerers, then are they moſt conquered. <hi>Ignatius</hi> going to his martyrdome, was ſo ſtrongly rauiſhed with the ioyes of heauen, that he burſt out into theſe words: Nay, come fire, come beaſts, come breaking of all my bones, rackings of my body, come all the torments of the diuell together vpon me, come what can come in the whole earth or in hell, ſo that I may enioy Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the end.</p>
               <p>One ſeeing a martyr ſo merry and iocund in going to his death, <note place="margin">Luk. 22.44.</note> did aske him why he was ſo merry at his death, ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe ſwet water and bloud before his Paſſion? Chriſt (ſaid the martyr) ſuſtained in his bodie all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1365:109"/> and conflicts, with hell and death due vnto vs for our ſinnes, by whoſe ſorrowes and ſufferings (ſaith he) we are deliuered from all the ſorrowes and feares of hell, death and damnation. For ſo plenteous was the paſſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, as, that faint and cold ſweat that is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs in the agonie of our death, the ſame he hath ſanctified by the warme and bloudy ſweat of his agony, and making the graue a quiet withdrawing chamber for our bodies, and death which before was ſo terrible to body &amp; ſoule, is now by his meanes become the very doore and entrance into the kingdome of glory. And hereof Bleſſed <hi>Hillary,</hi> who from the fourteenth yeere of his age ſerued the Lord in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes of heart, and in ſinceritie of life to his liues end, ſpake theſe words vpon his death-bed. Goe forth my ſoule goe forth, why art thou afraid? Thou haſt ſerued Chriſt theſe ſeuenty yeeres, and art thou now afraid to depart? Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> the night before he did ſuffer, at his laſt ſupper, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his hoſteſſe &amp; the reſt at the table with him, to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for, ſaid he, tomorrow I muſt be married, ſhewing thereby how ioyfull he was to die, and how little he feared, ſeeing that hee well knew hee was to goe to Chriſt his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
               <p>So by theſe examples wee ſee what great troubles the Saints, and ſeruants, and martyrs of God endured, and how ioyfull they were as at a royal feaſt, in all thoſe troubles and ſufferings of Chriſt, that they might enter vpon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable death of the righteous. They were ſo farre from fearing death, as worldlings feare it, that they ran gladly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, in hope of the Reſurrection, and reioyced in the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come day of death, as in a day of the greateſt good that could befall them. Why then ſhould we feare death at all, to whom many things happen far more bitter and heauie then death it ſelfe, and yet nothing ſo bitter and heauie, as happened to theſe Martyrs and Saints of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore when thou commeſt to die, ſet before thine eyes Chriſt thy Sauiour, in the middeſt of all his torments
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:1365:110"/> vpon the Croſſe, his body whipped, head thorned, face ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon, his cheekes buffeted, his ſides goared, his bloud ſpilt, his heart pierced, and his ſoule tormented, repleniſhed on the croſſe with a threefold plenitude, as true God, true man, God and man, <hi>gloria, gratia, poena,</hi> full of glorie and all magnificence, becauſe true God, full of grace and mercy, becauſe God and man, and full of paine and miſerie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perfect man, a paine continuing long, various in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting, and bitter in ſuffering. One ſaith hee continued in his torments twentie houres at the leaſt; others ſay, he was ſo long in paine on the croſſe, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in Paradiſe with pleaſure: for it was conuenient that at what time the doore of life was ſhut againſt the ſinner, in the ſame moment the gate of Paradiſe ſhould be open to the penitent, and at what houre the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> brought death into the world by ſinne, in the ſame the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould deſtroy death in the world by the Croſſe. Others report that Chriſt ſlept not for fifteene nights before his Paſſion in remembrance of the paine; yea from the firſt houre of his birth to the laſt minute of his death, hee did cary the croſſe of our redemption. In the beholding of which ſpectacle to thy endleſſe ioy and comfort, thou ſhalt ſee Paradiſe in the middeſt of hell, God the Father reconciled vnto thee, God the Sonne and thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour reaching forth his hand toward thee, for to ſuccour thee, and to receiue thy ſoule vnto himſelfe, and God the holy Ghoſt ready to embrace thee, and thou ſhalt ſee the Croſſe of Chriſt, <note place="margin">Gen. 28.12.</note> as <hi>Iacobs</hi> Ladder ſet vpon the earth, and the toppe of it reaching heauen, and the Angels of God aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and deſcending on it, to cary and aduance thy ſoule to eternall life and glory.</p>
               <p>Then ſeeing wee are thus graced by God both in our life and at our death, be not thou afraid to die. And ſure it is the will of God, <note place="margin">Matth. 20.22.</note> that you ſhould drinke of the cup that he hath filled for you, and therefore pray that you may ſuppe it vp with patience, and receiue great comfort thereby.</p>
               <p>Againe, there be three things that make death tollerable
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:1365:110"/> to euery godly Chriſtian. The firſt is the neceſſitie of dying; the ſecond, the facilitie of dying; the third, the felicitie of dying. For the firſt, that which cannot be auoided by any power, muſt be endured with all patience. <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8.8.</note> 
                  <hi>There is no man</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>hath power ouer the ſpirit to retaine it, neither hath he power in the day of death.</hi> The firſt age had it, and therein may pleade antiquitie; the ſecond age felt it, and may pleade, continuance; the laſt, age hath it, and may plead propertie in all fleſh, till ſinne and time ſhall be no more. Call it then no new thing that is ſo ancient, nor a ſtrange thing that is ſo vſuall; neither call it an euill properly thine, which is ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all the world. Wilt thou feare that to be done, which is alwayes in doing, I meane thy dying; and doſt thou feare to die in thy laſt day, when by little and little thou dyeſt euery day? Oh, well ſaid the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.31.</note> 
                  <hi>I proteſt by our reioycing, which I haue in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord I dye daily.</hi> Then I may well ſay yee are alwayes dying, and death is ſtill in doing. <hi>Remember my iudgement</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Syrach</hi>) <hi>for thine alſo ſhall be ſo; yeſterday for me,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 38.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and to day for thee. Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>All things haue heere their time, you to day, and I to morrow, and ſo the end of</hi> Adams <hi>line is ſoone</hi> runne out. Death is the Empreſſe and Lady of all the world, it ſeaſeth vpon all fleſh without ſurrender of any, till the day of reſtauration, no place, no preſence, no time can backe it; there is no priuiledge againſt the graue, <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 41.4.</note> there is no inquiſition in the graue, there is no pitie to bee ſhewed by the graue, there is no pleading with the graue: <hi>For there is no worke</hi> (ſaith the Preacher) <hi>nor deuiſe, nor knowledge,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>nor wiſdome in the graue, whither thou goeſt.</hi> And therefore anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie neuer made altar to Death, or deuotion to the graue, becauſe it was implacable, euer found to be cruell, and neuer felt to be kinde.</p>
               <p>And heere from the neceſſitie of dying, wee come to the facilitie of dying, which maketh it leſſe fearefull, and more tollerable, for that the ſence of death is of no continuance, it is buried in its own birth, it vaniſheth in its own thought,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:1365:111"/> and the paine is no ſooner begunne, but is preſently ended. Though the fleſh bee weake and fraile, yet the ſpirit is ſtrong to encounter the crueltie of Death, and to make it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a kinde kiſſe, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.16.</note> then a cruell croſſe. <hi>We faint not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for though the outward man periſh, yet the inward man is renued day by day.</hi> Our Sauiour Chriſt ſaid at his death and laſt farewell, <note place="margin">Iohn 17.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Father the houre is come, glorifie thy Sonne, that thy Sonne alſo may glorifie thee.</hi> Is there glory in death, and is death but an houre? It is of no long abode, that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth but an houre; and little doe I doubt, but that in that houre the ſoule is more rauiſhed with the ſight of God, then the bodie is tormented with the ſence of death. Nay I am further perſwaded that in the houre of my death, the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mortalitie is ſo beaten backe with impreſſion of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, that the fleſh feeleth nothing, but what the ſoule of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth, and that is God, from whom it came, and whither it would (as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) with as great haſt as happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore, whether you pleaſe to define or diuine of death, what it is, if it bee rightly broken into parts and paſſages, the elect of God ſhall finde it a very eaſie paſſage, euen as it were but a going out of priſon, a ſhaking off of our giues, an end of baniſhment, a breaking off our bands, a deſtruction of toile, an arriuing at the hauen, a iourney fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the caſting off an heauie burthen, the alighting from a madde and furious horſe, the going out of a tottering and ruinous houſe, the end of all griefes, the eſcape of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the deſtroyer of all euels, Natures due, Countries ioy, and heauens bliſſe. And from hence doe flow thoſe ſweete appellations, by which the holy Ghoſt, which is the Spirit of truth, doth deſcribe the death of the godly, in ſaying that they are gathered or congregated to their people, that is, to the company of the bleſſed and triumphing Church in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: to come to thoſe which haue deceaſed before them in the true faith, or rather haue gone thither before them. So that the holy Ghoſt vſeth a moſt ſweete <hi>Periphraſis</hi> of death; as ſpeaking of the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 25.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> Abraham <hi>gaue
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1365:111" rendition="simple:additions"/> vp the ghoſt, and died in a good old age,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 35.29. Gen. 49 33. Numb. 20.24. Num. 27.13.</note> 
                  <hi>an old man and full of yeeres, and was gathered to his people.</hi> And of the death of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac, And Iſaac gaue vp the ghoſt, and died, and was gathered vnto his people:</hi> and ſo likewiſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is but the taking of a iourney, which we thinke to bee death, it is not an end, but a paſſage, it is not ſo much an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration, as a tranſmigration from worſe things to better, a taking away of the ſoule, and a moſt bleſſed conueying of it from one place to another, not an aboliſhing; for the ſoule is taken from hence, and tranſpoſed into a place of eternall reſt; it is a paſſage and aſcenſion to the true life, it is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, becauſe by it the godly paſſe out of the ſlauerie of ſinne, to true libertie, euen as heretofore the Iſraelites out of the bondage of Egypt into the promiſed land. And as S. <hi>Peter</hi> termes it, it is a laying downe of the tabernacle, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.14. 2. Cor. 5.4.</note> for ſo he ſtiles our bodies. And as S. <hi>Paul</hi> termes it, it is an vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or putting off of it, and a remouing out of the bodie from a moſt filthie lodging to a moſt glorious dwelling. They are ſaid to be looſed from a port or from a priſon, and to come to Chriſt, <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> ſeeing they are led out of the Inne of this preſent life to the heauenly Countrey, and out of the dregs of wicked men to the moſt bleſſed ſocietie of Chriſt and his Saints in heauen. They are looſed by death out of the bonds of the bodie: for euen as cattell, when they haue diſcharged the labour of the whole day, at laſt about the euening are ſet free: and as they which are bound in priſon are looſed from their fetters, ſo the godly are led foorth by death from the yoke of their labours and ſorrowes of this life, and out of the filthie priſon of ſinne, and by a wonderfull and moſt ſweet tranſlation are caried to a better life.</p>
               <p>Out of all which it clearely appeareth, <note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> how truely the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath called the death of the godly <hi>aduantage,</hi> ſeeing it is aduantage to haue eſcaped the increaſe of ſinne, aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by auoyding worſe things to paſſe to better, from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and daunger to perfect reſt and ſecurity, and which is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:1365:112"/> all in all to eternall bleſſedneſſe. All which appellations of death, doe teach vs to be ſo farre from beeing afraid of it, that we ought willingly to welcome it, as the eaſie and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meſſenger of our happy deliuerance, and not ſing loth to depart, as all worldlings doe, who tremble at the very name of it.</p>
               <p>And thus I paſſe from the facility of dying, to the felicitie of dying, of which I may ſay as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did of his riddle, <hi>Out of the eater came meate,</hi>

                  <hi>and is full of miſery.</hi> O ſweet death, that turneth time into eternity, and miſery into mercie: ſo graciouſly hath our Sauiour done for vs, making medicines of maladies, cures of wounds, and ſalues of ſores, and to his children producing health out of ſickneſſe, light out of darkneſſe, and life out of death. <note place="margin">Pſal. 27.13.</note> This made <hi>Dauid</hi> to daunce in the midſt of all his affliction and calamitie, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhould ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily haue fainted, vnleſſe I had beleeued to ſee the goodneſſe of the Lord in the land of the liuing.</hi> This hath ſupported the ſoules of Gods Saints in the ſeas of their ſorrowes, when they thought vpon the day of their diſſolution, wherein they ſhould be made glorious by their deliuerance.</p>
               <p>For as our Sauiour Chriſt tooke his flight from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Virgins wombe, from her wombe to the world, from the world to the croſſe, from the croſſe to the graue, from the graue vnto heauen againe: Euen ſo from the womb wee muſt follow his ſteppes, and tread the ſame path that he hath traced out for vs. <note place="margin">Iohn 14.6.</note>

               <p>Let <hi>Agamades</hi> and <hi>Trophonius</hi> aſſoile the doubt, of whom it is writen by <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Axiaco,</hi> that after they had buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the temple of <hi>Apollo-Delphick:</hi> they begged of God that he would grant to them that which would bee moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for them; who after this ſuite made went to bed, and there tooke their laſt ſleepe, being both found dead the day after; in token that the day of death is better then the day of life, this being the entrance into all miſery, and that the end of all miſery, yea our diſſolution is nothing elſe, but <hi>aeterni natalis,</hi> the birth day of eternitie, as <hi>Seneca</hi> calles it more truly then he was aware: For this diſſolution giues to our ſoules an entrance and admiſſion into the moſt bleſſed ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of eternall glorie with God himſelfe: for what other thing is death to the faithfull, but the funerall of their vices, and the reſurrection of their vertues.

               <p>An immature and vntimely death, for a man to be taken away before he be come to the full period of his life, that by the courſe of nature, and in the eye of reaſon he might haue attained vnto, is a thing that may betide good men, and not be a curſe to them. <note place="margin">Eſay 57.1.</note>

               <p>Now this truth is confirmed vnto vs by two arguments, the one drawne from the malice of the wicked againſt the godly, the other from the mercie of God to the godly.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the wicked through their malice ſeeke by all meanes to cut off the godly, becauſe their wickedneſſe and ſinfull life is reproued by their godly conuerſation, neither can they follow their ſins ſo freely as they would, nor quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without detection or checke.

He counteth vs as baſtards, and he withdraweth himſelfe from

For if the righteous man be the ſonne of God, he will helpe him and deliuer him from the hands of his enemies. Let vs examine him with rebukes and torments, that wee may know his meekeneſſe, and prooue his patience. Let vs condemne him vnto a ſhameful death: for he ſhall be preſerued as he himſelfe ſayth.</hi>

                  <hi>Plotinus</hi> the Philoſopher (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath it) ſawe in part this very thing, that men are bodily mortal, and thought it an appurtenance to the mercy of God the Father, leſt they ſhould alwaies be tied to the miſery of this life. It is no leſſe mercie to be taken ſooner away, that they may ſee and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer leſſe miſery, which the length of their daies would effect. Therefore the godly man dies well, whether he die in a good age, or in the firſt flower of his youth. By how much the more timely the heauenly Generall doth call thee backe out of the ſtation of this life, by ſo much the ſooner doth he place thee in a place of reſt, peace and victorie. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it may be you will obiect and ſay, I am loth and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die, becauſe then I muſt leaue my louing wife, my deere children and kinsfolkes. I anſwere, howſoeuer we be left and forſaken, or rather ſequeſtred and ſeparated from our wiues, children, kinsfolkes and friends by death, yet are we not forſaken of God, nor of his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. But take heed that thou be not ſo carefull for the bodily ſafetie of wife, children, kinsfolkes and friends, that in the meane time thou neglect the care of thy ſoule. Behold, he cals thee by death, take heed thou doe not ſo loue thy wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that therefore thou refuſe to follow God calling thee with a ready heart. The loue of thy heauenly Father muſt bee preferred before the loue of children: the loue of our bridegroome Chriſt Ieſus before the loue of thy wife, the benefit muſt not bee more loued then the benefactor. And we muſt conſider that we, our wiues, children, kinsfolks and friends are all as it were trauellers, going forth of this world, in a maner, we take our voyage together; if wee goe a litle
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1365:115"/> before, <note place="margin">2. Gen. 24. Mat. 19.5.</note> they ſhall follow ſhortly after. Wherefore as at the beginning of our mariage and acquaintance, God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point that we ſhould leaue father and mother, and cleaue to our wiues, euen ſo now in this caſe, it ought not to grieue vs to leaue them when God will haue it ſo, and to returne vnto him, who is better vnto vs, then father, mother, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, friends or any thing els: yea he is worth ten thouſand of them, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18.3. 1. Cor. 15.28.</note> as the people ſaid of <hi>Dauid;</hi> yea he then ſhalbe all in all to vs. Therefore let the godly ones fetch comfort from hence, that though by death they leaue the world, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and friends and kinsfolkes, yet they ſhall bee gathered to their fathers, kinsfolkes and friends.</p>
               <p>I reade of <hi>Socrates</hi> being but an heathen man, that when <hi>Crito</hi> perſwaded him, that if he would not regard his life for his own ſake, yet for his wife, children, kinsfolks and friends ſake, which depended on him: he anſwered, God will care for my wife and children, who firſt gaue them vnto me, and for my kinsfolks and friends, I ſhal find the like vnto them, and farre better in the life to come, neither ſhall I long want your companie, for you alſo are going thither, and ſhall ſhortly be in the ſame place: and they are not loſt but ſent before vs, <note place="margin">Eſay 26.19.</note> neither are they dead, but fallen aſleepe, hereafter they ſhall awake, ſaith S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and they ſhall riſe againe, and we ſhall ſee one another, and reioyce and ſing.</p>
               <p>Againe, another obiection: Oh, but my debt is great, if I die now, how can I be comforted at my death, for after my death my creditors will come and ſeize on all that I haue, ſo cruell are they, and mercileſſe, and ſo ſhall my poore wife and children be vndone for euer: and therefore I would to God I might liue to be out of debt, and to leaue my wife and children free, though I left them litle or nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. Alas, how ſhall I doe, nay how ſhal they doe? This is it that tormenteth my heart, when I thinke of it: theſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts goe to bed with me, lodge all night with mee, and riſe with mee, and lyeth all day in my boſome; theſe things conſidered, what comfort can I haue in death, dying in ſuch a caſe?</p>

To all which mindes thus grieued and pinched, I ſay this, you cannot commit your wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the hands of a more faithfull guardian and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, then God is; for he will take them into his charge and protection.

               <p>Wherefore, let it not grieue thee to die, but thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue comfort, if God will haue it ſo, leaue all to him, and remember his promiſes, together with this practiſe, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your wife and children to God, and he will protect and prouide for them. Therefore what is vnpaid by thee, he will pay as ſhall be beſt, and effect what you cannot thinke of, to giue teſtimony of his mercy to you and yours. So God is not tyed to your leaſes and liuings, when they ſhall deſcend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if he pleaſe he will vſe them, if not, he can well want them, and yet pay all, <note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>and the Lord giue thee vnderſtanding in all theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſufficient to waigh theſe matters with the waights of the Lords Sanctuarie, and not needfull to try them by fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching helpes of humane reaſon. Yet to giue them ouer mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that will not reſt ſatisfied with the comforts which the holy Scripture doth affoord, let it bee firſt conſidered what humane wit and reaſon hath ſaid in this caſe.</p>
               <p>And touching this matter which now is mooued, I haue read, and you may ſee what Heathens by learning and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, haue ſaid to themſelues and their friends in ſuch loſſes; but this did I neuer read, neither ſhall you finde, that all their comforts haue counteruailed one promiſe out of Gods booke. I confeſſe the bookes of heathen Writers doe promiſe comfort in this caſe, but (alas) they performe it not:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1365:119"/> but are like a brooke that ſwels in winter when there is no need of it, and is dry in Summer when the paſſenger fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and panteth for heat: no, if we will haue good gold, we muſt goe to Ophir: if good balme, to Gilead: if good wine, to Chriſt at the wedding of Cana: and if good tidings, to the booke of God. They did ſay well in many things, but neuer like this word that is from the Lord. <note place="margin">Iohn 7.46.</note> 
                  <hi>For neuer man ſpake like this man,</hi> as the officers told the chiefe Prieſtes and Phariſies concerning Chriſt. They conſidered the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of death, the miſeries of life, the examples of great men that had gone before them, and ſuch like. But what are theſe to thoſe that the word of God will ſhew vs; our ſafety in Chriſt, our reſurrection in immortality in the preſence of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, with ſuch like, yet both good vnto a ſanctified mind.</p>
               <p>Firſt the neceſſitie of death is a true comfort againſt death, be it of our ſelues, or of our friends; no liuing fleſh but muſt die, as we haue heard in the firſt Diuiſion. <hi>What man is hee</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that liueth and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.48.</note> And ſhall we feare that in our ſelues, or bewaile immoderatly that in our friends, which cannot be auoided? This were with witleſſe wil to diſturbe the peace of our whole life, and with a ſeruile dread of the laſt houre, to bereaue of comfort all the reſt of our houres that we are to liue in this preſent euill world, which in your iudgment conceiue how fond a thing it were.</p>
               <p>The carefull view of natures courſe, doth ſhew vs degrees from age to age till we come to a full, and a like decreaſe by ſtep after ſtep, till we come to the change againe. Youth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth childhood, and age followeth youth by aſſured ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, if we liue. But when we are children, wee feare not to be men, neither when we are men, to become olde; but many rather wiſh it, why then ſhould we either feare in our ſelues, or lament in our friends, death to follow age in his courſe appointed, more then age to follow youth, as was ſaid before? Surely the one muſt bee receiued as well as the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1365:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> other without choice. And whereas Chriſt ſaid in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel touching man and wife, <note place="margin">Matth. 19.9.</note> 
                  <hi>What therefore God hath ioyned together, let no man put in ſunder,</hi> it may be more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſaid of this, What God hath ioyned or coupled together no man can ſeparate nor put aſunder. And therfore a wiſe content both in our friends, and in our ſelues ſhall become vs beſt. Who will not die, let him neuer liue; for we receiue the one to endure the other when God appointeth, and we muſt all die both friend and foe: to wiſe men neceſſitie is a comfort, and ſo (I hope) to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the miſeries of this life is another head, from whence heathen men haue deriued comfort againſt death, be it of our ſelues, or of our friends. Conſider then with your ſelfe from the firſt age vnto the laſt houre, the diſeaſes incident to our bodies, to vexe vs with woe, according to their ſeuerall natures, ſome more, ſome leſſe, and yet the leaſt too much. All the changes and chances of this moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſinfull world; whereunto, whilſt we liue wee muſt lye open, will we nill we; from all which our death doth free vs, and our friends. Therefore how ſhould wee either feare or ſorrow for our ſelues or for our friends, for that which doth ſo befriend vs? If we conceiue hereof as we ought, we muſt needs be of the ſame iudgment with <hi>Seneca,</hi> and in ſome ſort approoue his ſpeech: O men moſt ignorant (ſaith hee) of their owne miſeries, who praiſe not death as the beſt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that euer nature had, which includeth felicity, excludeth miſerie, finiſheth the toyles of age, preuenteth the perils of youth; to many is a remedie, to ſome a wiſh, to all an end, and deſerueth better of none then them, to whom it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before it be called. Yea we muſt confeſſe (theſe things beeing well conſidered) that it befalleth to men concerning death, as vnto young children concerning their friends. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children if their friends bee diſguiſed with ſome ſtrange ſhewes, they are afraid of them, and crying, flie from them, <note place="margin">Exod. 4.3.</note> as ſome that would hurt them; as <hi>Moyſes</hi> fled from his rod of death, when it was turned into a Serpent. But take off theſe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1365:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> vizards that their friends may appeare as they are, and then by and by they are comforted and reioyce, and imbrace them gladly againe: euen ſo it is of death, when we are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it appeareth vnto vs diſguiſed and couered by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth, and his approaching maketh vs ſhrinke, but plucke off that vizard of ſuppoſed euill, and behold it as it is to vs in Chriſt, and it is then but a painted death, and we ſee him then our great friend, that cutteth the thrid that we do weaue, and then we neither flie nor feare any more, but are truely comforted, and imbrace him moſt willingly as we ought, and loue him as <hi>Ionathan</hi> loued his friend <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.1.</note> as his owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the heathen conſidered againe the famous and worthy men that died before them, and what they endured, and could not auoid; and therevpon thought great ſhame either to feare or flie, to lament in themſelues or in their friends. The greateſt lights that euer were amongſt them died all; <hi>Socrates, Demoſthenes, Plato, Pompey, Caeſar, Cicero,</hi> learned, martiall, or whatſoeuer; yea what wiſedome and knowledge, what valour and proweſſe, what act, what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ſoeuer they had, all gifts and graces, all pompe and power, all empire and maieſtie, were it ouer thouſands, or thouſand thouſands, yeelded to death, death had his place, when his time was come; and as well theſe great lights and loftie gallants, as the loweſt wretches and pooreſt wormes, the high okes, as the ſmall ſhrubs, drunke of deaths cuppe, when they were inuited and inioyned.</p>
               <p>Shall it not then euen in reaſon ſeeme vniuſt and vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, if any of leſſe merit, yea of no merit, in compariſon of ſuch men, ſhall grieue for themſelues, or any friend of theirs to indure that which theſe indured. Surely not onely to grieue, but not moſt willingly to welcome, what all theſe men imbraced, is tenderneſſe, intolerable folly, vnfitting, and a fault no way to bee excuſed. Yea the fault is ſo much the greater, by how much either you or your friend are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to theſe men in ſeruice and vſe vnto the common ſtate.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1365:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Thus did the heathens ſeek to ſalue the ſore which grew by death of any, and to this end many things of like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, they heaped vp, which I paſſe ouer, as haſtening to the word of God, without all compariſon the fountaine of all comfort. This onely I ſay, and pray you to obſerue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the mention made of the heathen, that it is meant only to ſhew, that they were aſhamed to feare death in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or immoderately bewaile it in any friend, and will you faile of the ſtrength of an heathen? ſhall they fight bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt fooliſh affections by the light of nature, then you by the power of grace, and the moſt bright Sunſhine of Gods word? God forbid: and as you tender your credit to be iudged truly a ſouldier that anſwereth the promiſe made in baptiſme, that you would fight manfully vnder Chriſtes banner, and not yeeld to your foe, and Gods enemy and yours: let not Sathan ouercome you in this to make you worſe then an heathhen, more paſſionate, more impatient, more ſubiect to wil, and leſſe ſubiect to reaſon, nay more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to God and of leſſe reputation before men, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of your mind then they were. You know more, performe not leſſe then they did: you haue ſeene a light that they neuer ſaw, nor many other worthy men. <note place="margin">Luke 10.23.24</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed are the eyes</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>which ſee the things which ye ſee; for I tell you that many Prophets and Kings haue deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and haue not ſeene them, and to heare thoſe things which ye heare, and haue not heard them.</hi> Walk therfore in that light as a child of light, that you may bee more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted for the death of your friends, then the very heathen were <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, He that laments that a man is dead, laments that he was a man. And now to come to the word of God, to the Law, <note place="margin">Iſay 8.20.</note> and to the teſtimony (ſaith the Prophet) euen to the ſweet fountaine of Iſrael, that cooles indeede the ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching heat of all ſorrowes, and by name of this, when God taketh away any of our friends by death, if <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Prophets will not comfort vs in this caſe, then (as <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Diues</hi> in another caſe) nothing can perſwade, <note place="margin">Luke 16.31.</note> nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with vs.</p>

                  </gap>es farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. <hi>Iob</hi> had his Oxen and Aſſes taken away by ſtrangers, and his ſeruants ſlaine with the edge of the ſword. This was his firſt newes. The fire of God fell downe from heauen, and burnt vp his ſheepe and his ſeruants, and conſumed them. This was the ſecond newes, His Camels were taken by the Chaldeans, and his ſeruants ſlaine. This the third newes, all of them bitter and grieuous to happen at once. You will confeſſe this was ſore, and any one of them falling by it ſelfe alone vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many of vs in theſe daies, would plunge vs very ſore. Yet ſee farre greater, his fourth and laſt newes was, that his ſonnes and daughters were eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wine in their eldeſt brothers houſe, and there came a great winde from the wilderneſſe, and ſmote the foure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the houſe, and the houſe fell vpon them, and they all died, yea all, and all at once, by this ſudden meanes, to the vtter amazing and aſtoniſhing of all that ſhould ſee or think of it. Yet for all this (ſaith the holy Ghoſt) <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſin, to wit, by rauing and railing impatiently, nor did he charge God fooliſhly, as dealing vniuſtly or cruelly with him; but conſidered with himſelfe, who had giuen, and who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and weighed with himſelfe that they were Gods and not his, and ſhould he forbid the Lord to doe with his owne what was his good pleaſure? <hi>Is it not lawfull</hi> (ſaith our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt in another caſe) <hi>for me to doe what I will with mine owne.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 20.15.</note> Therefore ſweetly and meekely, patiently and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he caſt vp his eyes, his heart, his ſoule, his minde, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and all vnto the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the name
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1365:121"/> of the Lord;</hi> of which Lord? ſurely of this Lord that had thus dealt with him, and taken away all that euer he had.</p>
               <p>God hath not dealt thus with you, by many and many degrees with you at this time; and will you then take on, and (as it were) bid battell to the Lord, by weepings and wailings, by ſobbings and ſighings, by groanings and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by mutterings and murmurings, and by ſuch like teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a diſcontented and offended minde, aboue that which can ſtand with a dutifull childes behauiour to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father? If your loſſes were as great as <hi>Iobs</hi> was, yet you ſee what he did, and this was Gods Spirit in him, much more in a farre leſſe loſſe muſt you doe it, if you bee endued with the ſame ſpirit. Thinke with your ſelfe (as you ſee <hi>Iob</hi> did) what eſtate you had in this friend of yours, that now you haue loſt; you held him not in fee, but for a terme, and what terme? no certaine terme, but during the Lords good will and pleaſure. Now your terme is out, and the Lord will haue his owne againe. Grieue not for the loſſe then, but be thankfull for the loane ſo long.</p>
               <p>Againe, I warrant you, <hi>Iob</hi> did carefully ponder with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, what the Heathen, and ſtrangers to religion about him would ſay. If he ſhould be impatient and outragious, they would ſay, ſee euen thus the man that feared God, and was ſo religious, that he taught others, and rebuked many when they did offend, that ſpake ſo much of the Lord, and had his will ſo euer in his mouth, that gaue ſuch teſtimonies ſundry wayes to the ſhew of man of a reformed life, now where is all become? Now ſee this mans practiſe, how it anſwereth his ſpeeches, before he was tried; what doe we ſee now in him more then in many others that made not halfe the ſhew? Is there but ſo much in him, as in many Heathen that knew not his religion? Haue they not taken patiently loſſe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, mothers, husbands, wiues, children and friends &amp;c. and neuer ſtarted at it, in compariſon of this man? O vaine fable then of religion, that yeelds no more patience nor quiet content of need. Wee will no ſuch religion for our
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1365:122"/> parts, neither will wee hereafter regard this man, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, &amp;c. What a fearefull fruite had this beene of <hi>Iobs</hi> impatience? how could the Lord haue indured it at his hands, if he had in this ſort opened the mouthes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked againſt his holy feare. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> laid his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his mouth, and ſubmitted himſelfe wholly with all his affections to the Lords good wil and pleaſure, without cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing any one to ſpeake euill by his meanes, to his praiſe, and Gods good liking, as a memoriall for all poſterity. For as our Sauiour Chriſt told the Diſciples, touching the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woman that annointed him with a very pretious and coſtly oyntment to his buriall, ſaying. <note place="margin">Matth. 26.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, whereſoeuer this Goſpel ſhal be preached in the whole world, there ſhall alſo this, that this woman hath done be told for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of her.</hi> Euen ſo it may be ſaid touching the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the patience of <hi>Iob</hi> in this caſe. That whereſoeuer this ſtorie of <hi>Iob</hi> ſhall be read and preached, there ſhall alſo this that he hath performed, be told for a memoriall of him. And therefore to this purpoſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Yee haue heard of the patience of</hi> Iob, <note place="margin">Iam. 5.11.</note> 
                  <hi>and haue ſeene the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitifull and of tender mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe is yours at this time, in ſome ſort and meaſure, you haue loſt a loſſe, and mens eyes are vpon you, you haue loued the truth, and ſpoken of the Lords feare before diuers; now they looke for the power of it in your ſelfe; and as they ſee you now to gouerne your affections according to the ſame ſo happily will they thinke both of Religion, and of your ſelfe, while they liue.</p>
               <p>Therefore plucke vp your heart in Gods name, and ſhew patience and comfort, and cauſe not the name of God to be blaſphemed among the wicked and irreligious, <note place="margin">Rom. 2 24.</note> through your impatience; but honor the Lord by bleſſing his name, as <hi>Iob</hi> did honor his truth, which you profeſſe by a godly gouernment and ſtay of a weake nature, and as the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he will honor you againe, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> with mercie and compaſſion, that ſhall counteruaile this loſſe, and farre
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1365:122"/> exceed it, for all is the Lords that you enioy, and this friend of yours was his alſo. He hath not taken all, but part, and left you much more then he hath taken. Both now and euer be content with his holy will, he gaue, and none but he; he hath taken, and none but he, not mine, but his own, my time was out, and the right returneth to the true owner. I may not grudge a mortall man his owne, when my time is out; much leſſe God, my deare God, my moſt mercifull Father, that yet ſendeth mee many mercies and comforts, though this be gone.</p>

Not ſinning yet for all this with his lips,</hi> as the holy Ghoſt there ſaith, but bridling his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that his tongue through intemperancie did not once murmure againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now marke, I pray you, <hi>Iobs</hi> reaſons to his wife: He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her that both hee and ſhee had, receiued many good things at Gods hand, and therfore they were bound to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch woe as the Lord ſhould ſend, without any way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grudging or repining at the change, becauſe by good things, wee are bound to take worſe things in good part, if the Lord doe ſend them. As for himſelfe he followeth this rule, and for the manifold mercies which he had receiued, he will now endure with willing heart and quiet minde the miſery which was preſent. Bleſſed <hi>Iob,</hi> thou man of God, for thy thus doing, how ſweet was this argument in Gods eares, that preuailed ſo little with thy wayward wife?</p>
               <p>Apply this now to your owne eſtate, and tell me, as you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1365:123"/> tender the truth, whether God hath not beene ſo good to you many waies as vnto <hi>Iob?</hi> Caſt vp the bils of your receits, and call your ſelues to a Chriſtian <hi>audit,</hi> and I warrant you the <hi>ſumma totalis</hi> will amount very high, and yet you can neuer remember the one halfe. Thinke then what <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid for his part, that he tooke himſelfe bound by the good, to endure the euill, and ſo if your caſe be not all one, you may not gain-ſay it; and therefore vnleſſe you will wilfully fight againſt the Lords good will and pleaſure, you muſt yeeld as hee did, and in effect of words ſay with him. O my deare God and bleſſed Father, God of all comfort and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how many haue thy mercies beene vpon me, and to me? How deepe a draught haue I drunke of this ſweete cup of thine? Now thou haſt taken one comfort from me, ſhall I ſet the one againſt the other, as thy ſeruant <hi>Iob</hi> did? <hi>Shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good things of thine hand, and not euill?</hi> Shall I preſcribe vnto thee what I will haue? O farre be it from me, I thanke thee my deare God, for thine infinit and manifold mercies, and in this change I humbly caſt downe my ſelfe at the foot of thy Maieſtie, and let thy will bee done, and not mine. Lord make me content, and I am content as a weak wretch may be content. By my loſſe thou haſt gained, and I doubt not, but that this friend of mine is remoued from mee to dwell with thee, at the which I may not grudge; many mercies I enioy ſtill, and they ſhall content and pleaſe mee. Thus if you reaſon, you ſhall pleaſe God, reſemble <hi>Iob</hi> heere before your eyes, and that eye of God that ſpied him, and was glorified by the patience of his ſeruant, he ſhall doe the like to you, to your great ioy and comfort. Comfort your ſelfe in the Lord then, after this ſort, and remember this ſpeech of <hi>Iob</hi> to his wife. <hi>Iob</hi> receiued good things, ſo haue you: <hi>Iob</hi> receiued euill, and ſo muſt you; yet <hi>Iob</hi> was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſo ought you to be; which the God of patience grant vnto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> Thirdly, I think in this caſe of the bleſſed Apoſtles words, which are theſe. <hi>We know that all things worke together for the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1365:123"/> beſt to them that loue God.</hi> If the dead belonged then to God, this was beſt for him to be releaſed; and if your ſelfe belong to God, it is beſt for you alſo at this time to looſe him; beſt, I ſay, in the wiſdome of God, and to ſome end; (although not ſo in your owne reaſon, which ſeeth not ſo farre) and in all reſpects beſt. Now thinke with your ſelfe thus much, if you had done good to one, and pleaſured him much, and all the friends he hath, or any of them ſhould crie out for it, would it not grieue you? ſurely it would grieue you ſo much the more, by how much that vnthankefull diſlike ſhould be more vehement and laſt long. So it is with God; and therefore ſee what you doe, and whom you moue to anger. The Apoſtles words are plaine, <hi>All things worke for the beſt vnto them that feare God:</hi> if you beleue it, and alſo thinke of your dead friend and your ſelfe: God the holy Ghoſt (who cannot lye) concludeth that the ſame was beſt both for him and you, which now is come to paſſe.</p>
               <p>When good is done, we ſhould not grieue, and when the beſt is done, much leſſe ſhould we grieue; for God calleth him out of this life, when he is at his beſt, if he be good, that hee turne not to euill; if euill, that hee waxe not worſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then with ſorrow and ſowre lookes, and let the Lord for his mercie, receiue your thankes, from faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and not murmuring and repining from vnbridled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: not onely good is done, but the beſt, euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beſt, by the beſt that onely knowes what is beſt; and it ſhould appeaſe and ſatisfie you: God is no lyer, neither can he be deceiued, but if one houres life might haue been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either for him or you, then is not the beſt done; and then the Apoſtles words are not true; but that were wicked once to imagine ſo. Therefore no longer life would haue profited him or you, but the very beſt is done; bleſſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be God for his goodneſſe euer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I conſider what the ſame Apoſtle ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I deſire to be looſed and to be with Chriſt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>which is beſt of all.</hi> And I aske of you, whether your ſelfe do not the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1365:124"/> like, as you are able; if you doe not, you are yet ouer earthly, and further in loue with this wicked and ſinfull world then you ſhould be. If you doe it, why then grieue you that your friend hath obtained that which you deſire? this will ſeeme rather enuie then loue in you to conceiue diſlike for ones well doing. What, againe if your friend wiſh as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth, long before he obtained his requeſt, and now the Lord hath granted, what he ſo heartily wiſhed? this is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be reioyced for, and not any miſerie to bee wept for. A true friend acknowledgeth a debt for the pleaſuring of his friend, and is not mooued with anger or griefe for the ſame: ſtay then your teares, if you will bee iudged a friend, and neither grudge to God the companie of his child, nor to the child the preſence of his God, becauſe this is wicked. Thinke of the glorie, company, immortalitie, and ioy, and comfort with the bleſſed Trinity, and all the hoſte of heauen, that now your friend enioyeth, thinke of the woes and miſeries in this wretched vale of teares, from which he is freed, and then iudge you if the Apoſtle ſay not true, that it is beſt to be looſed and to be with Chriſt. If this beſt bee now at this inſtant fallen to your good friend by Gods good mercie, bleſſe God for it, and comfort your ſelf, that your friend enioyeth ſuch endleſſe ioy and comfort; and thereby ſhall you ſhew your ſelfe a friend indeed, and all that are godly and wiſe cannot but thinke well of you. Againe, the Apoſtle ſaith, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.6.8.</note> 
                  <hi>That we know, that whileſt wee are at home in the bodie, we are abſent from the Lord: therefore we loue rather to remoue out of the bodie, and to dwell with the Lord.</hi> From which abſence from God your friend is freed, and by preſence and dwelling with God he is now bleſſed; a true cauſe, and a great cauſe (as hath beene ſaid) of good content. Then doe not you prouoke the Lord with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull teares, ſighes, and groanes, but ſtay that courſe which offendeth greatly; and tread the ſteppes of all ſuch as vpon the like occaſion haue walked rightly by their diſcreet mourning. Who are euer patient and moderate in ſorrow,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1365:124"/> repreſſing and ruling their affections, and gaue them not a looſe reine, and ſo ought you. Againe, in the firſt Epiſtle to the Theſſalonians, it is ſaid; <hi>I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that ſleepe, that yee ſorrow not,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>as they which haue no hope.</hi> Reade the place, and examine your owne courſe, whether you hope or no. Firſt, that your friend is well, and then, that Almightie God will ſupply his want to you ſome other way: for both theſe are neceſſarie; our friends are our comforts if they be good. But if I tie God to them, and thinke all is gone when they are gone, where is my hope? what pleaſure to God, ſo to truſt in him, that I truſt more in my friends, and cry out when they goe? how ſhall I doe? how ſhall I liue? what ioy can I now haue? Is this hope? is this truſt? is this faith? fie, that euer affections and paſſions ſhould carie any good child of God ſo far from his dutie, and from true knowledge. I ſay againe, our friends are our comfort, while the Lord lendeth them, and when our friend returneth to his earth, yet the Lord is in heauen, where he euer was, (if I haue loſt my father) to be my father, mother, ſiſter, friend, yea all in all to me, whatſoeuer I want. Therefore while he liueth, which is and ſhall bee for euer, I cannot be friendleſſe, though my friends die or depart from me, but that either for one, he will raiſe me vp another, or himſelfe ſupplie the place which is beſt of all. Mourne not then I pray you as one without hope, but hearken vnto the Apoſtle, and ſhew foorth your faith, hope, and obedience vnto God, to the glorie of God and your owne praiſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee read in the booke of Leuiticus, <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.3.</note> that the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were ſlaine by the Lord in his anger, for their ſinnefull preſumption in offering vp ſtrange fire, which the Lord commanded them not, which was a fearefull ſight and ſpectacle to the fathers eyes, to ſee two ſonnes at once, and in ſuch ſort dead. Yet what did <hi>Aaron;</hi> I pray you marke the text, <hi>I will ſaith the Lord bee ſanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron</hi> (ſaith the holy Ghoſt there) <hi>held
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1365:125"/> his peace.</hi> And what an example is this, if any thing may mooue you to ſtay your affections for the death of your friends. Againe, it is ſaid in the booke of the Reuelation, <hi>And I heard a voyce from heauen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaying vnto me, Write, Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea</hi> (ſaith the Spirit) <hi>that they may reſt from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> Your friend is dead in the Lord, and therefore bleſſed: will you then weepe and lament for him? his workes follow him, and the Lord in mercie hath crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his obedience, according to his promiſe, and will you looke awry at it? God forbid. Againe, conſider with your ſelfe that your friends walk with God, and are gone to their heauenly Father in peace, they are gathered vnto their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are not dead, but ſleepe, and their fleſh reſteth in hope, they are gone the way of all fleſh, and doe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God in heauen, and what cauſe of ſorrow is this to any friend that loueth them? If your friend were diſcharged and releaſed out of priſon and miſerie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the palace of an earthly prince, and to his Court, to his great and exceeding ioy and content, would you ſhewe your loue and contentment toward him in bewailing the ſame? how much leſſe then ſhould you lament his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Gods euerlaſting Court and kingdome, to his vnſpeakable ioy and comfort?</p>
               <p>Thus may you gather many places of holy Scripture, and on this ſort meditate on them. For ſweet is the word of God againſt all ſorrowes and griefes, and by name againſt this.</p>
               <p>But it may happily be obiected, it is your child that is dead, and it died before it could well be baptized, this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me more then otherwiſe it would, and ſo you feare your childs eſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid that we ſhould either ſpeake or think ſo, ſeeing the Lord neuer ſaid ſo, but contrariwiſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſeth, that they are in the Couenant of God, and ſo in ſtate of ſaluation ſo ſoone as they are borne: and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth not make them Chriſtians that were none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1365:125"/> but is the Sacrament, the ſeale, the ſigne, the badge of them that are Chriſtians before. Beſides it is not the want of the Sacrament, that depriueth a man of Gods fauour: for the children of the Iſraelites were not circumciſed all thoſe fortie yeeres which they liued in the wilderneſſe: the reaſon whereof was, becauſe they were euer to remoue and iourney whenſoeuer the pillar of the cloud that was their guide, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and went forward, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.18, &amp;c. ſo that they were alwaies to attend vpon the cloude both night and day, not knowing when it would remooue; and therefore could not circumciſe their children in the wilderneſſe, as yee may read, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 5.2, &amp;c. but it is the contemning or deſpiſing of the Sacrament, that depriueth men of Gods fauour when they make no more account of it, then <hi>Eſau</hi> did of his birth-right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. then <hi>Ahaz</hi> did of the Lords helpe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7. and it is alſo the neglecting of it, when God offereth time and opportunitie that we might haue it. Againe, the Lord neuer ſaid, that whoſoeuer died vncircumciſed or vnbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſhould be wiped out of the booke of life, but hee hath ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that whoſoeuer contemneth, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly neglecteth the Sacraments, ſhal be cut off from among his people. And ſo read you the notes vpon that ſeuenteenth chapter of Geneſis, and I hope they ſhall content you for this matter. God is not tyed to the Sacrament, nor euer was. The contempt hurteth, but not the want, when it is againſt your will.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Happily your child was of ripe yeeres, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſo toward, that it could not be, but that he ſhould come to ſome great place and preferment if he had liued, both for the good of himſelf and his friends; and that he in his youth and the flower of his age, ſhould thus bee taken away, is a great loſſe ſay you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> True it is, that the loſſe is great in reſpect of the world, but what is that if we conſider God; God is alſo able to ſupplie all that, ſome other way, if we take it well. This is apparant, that what good or preferment could haue come
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1365:126"/> to him any way or to his friends, if he had liued, the Lord for ſome purpoſe as yet happily hidden, hath preuented: but yet his arme is not ſhortened, as I ſaid, to doe vs good ſome other way, but it might perhaps prooue otherwiſe contrarie to our expectation, if he had liued longer, and then it would haue beene a great griefe vnto vs. But admit that it would haue beene as you hope if he had liued longer, yet he is more highly preferred euen to the higheſt heauens, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and this no earthly preferment can match. And except we be wholy earthly our ſelues, we cannot but ſauour this, and not let his youth grieue vs, for no youth nor age is too good for God, when he is pleaſed to take them.</p>
               <p>A foole or a child ſeeing a goodly cluſter of grapes, thinketh it pitie to put them into the preſſe to deface them, but he that is wiſe knoweth that thereby the liquour which is in them is preſerued, and that this timely gathering is a meanes to keepe them from corruption. So we thinke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, Oh, it is great pitie ſuch a one ſhould die ſo ſoone, ſo towardly a youth, ſo good a creature can hardly be ſpared; but God in his wiſedome knoweth it to be good. And if he cut off the life of that good and godly king <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> as it were in the middle of the ſtemme, <note place="margin">2. Kings 22.20.</note> doubtleſſe it is for this cauſe, that his eies may not ſee the manifold euils to come. If you will be ruled to weigh things with reaſon, you may well ſee mercie euen in this timely death; for many are the perils both of bodie and ſoule, that young men auoid when they are taken hence, falſe doctrine, hereſies, errours, and many grieuous ſinnes, wounding the very conſcience with a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worme that euer gnaweth; publike calamities, and ruine of ſtate, many priuate miſeries great and grieuous, which no man can thinke of beforehand, more bitter to good men then any death: from all which this happie deliuerance in time of youth doth free your child, and ſet him ſafe, that you ſhall neuer mourne with him, nor for him that way. And herein we haue <hi>Dauid</hi> an example of godly fortitude, who hauing a child ſicke, did while it liued afflict his ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1365:126"/> God for the child, and faſted and wen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and lay all night vpon the earth, and would not be comforted. Thus while there was hope of remedie, he gaue way to the ſorrow of his heart, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.16.</note> but when <hi>Dauid</hi> perceiued that the child was dead, then he aroſe from the earth, and waſhed and anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe, and changed his apparell, and came into the houſe of the Lord, and worſhipped, and after came to his owne houſe, and bad that they ſhould ſet bread before him and he did eate. His ſorrow ended, when he once ſaw there was no hope of enioying any longer the companie of his child. Now this courſe ſeemed vnto his ſeruants a new and ſtrange kind of Philoſophie, that he ſhold mourn in the danger of death, and yet reioice, or at leaſt comfort himſelfe with any content in death. And therefore his ſeruants ſaid vnto him, <hi>What thing is this that thou haſt done,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.21,</note> 
                  <hi>thou diddeſt faſt and weepe for the child while it was aliue, but now he is dead thou doeſt ariſe and eate meat.</hi> And what reaſon had hee for this ſtrange and vnwonted behauiour? He ſaid, <hi>While the child was aliue I faſted and wept, for I ſayd, Who can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will haue mercie on me, that the child may liue, but now being dead, wherefore ſhall I faſt? Can I bring him againe any more. I ſhall goe to him, but hee ſhall not returne to mee any more.</hi> Behold the ſame thing that maketh thee to mourne, namely, that thy dead ſhall not returne to thee, the very ſame conſideration <hi>Dauid</hi> made the ground of his quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And thereupon he comforted his heart, and would not continue in heauinſſe for that which could not bee helped. So that it is to a right vnderſtanding man, ground inough to build content and quietneſſe of heart vpon, that God hath done his worke which thy ſorrow cannot reuoke. But peraduenture it will be here obiected, that afterward when <hi>Dauid</hi> heard of his ſonne <hi>Abſolons</hi> death, hee did ſo greatly lament and bewaile the ſame, that hee would in no ſort bee comforted quite contrarie to that which before hee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; for it is ſaid that <hi>he was much mooued,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18.33.</note> 
                  <hi>and went vp to the chamber ouer the gate, and wept as he went ſaying. O my ſonne</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1365:127"/> Abſolon, <hi>my ſonne, my ſonne</hi> Abſolon, <hi>would God I had died for thee. O</hi> Abſolon <hi>my ſonne, my ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the anſwering of this obiection, and your better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction herein, wee are to vnderſtand that <hi>Dauid</hi> knew that he had a wicked and rebellious ſonne, of the eſtate of whoſe ſaluation he had great cauſe to doubt, becauſe he died in rebellion, which indeed may ſeeme to bee the principall cauſe of his exceeding ſorrow and lamentation, and not ſo much for the death of his ſonne, as for that cauſe. But of his childe he beleeued that he died in the ſtate of grace, and ſo was made partaker of ſaluation, which was the cauſe that he was comforted preſently after his death, ſaying, that his ſon ſhould not returne, but that he himſelfe ſhould goe to him. Euen ſo in like manner, if we feare the eſtate of our childe or friend that is dead, then indeed haue wee great cauſe to weepe, mourne and lament for him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did heere for <hi>Abſolon:</hi> but if we haue no ſuch feare, and do hope well and the beſt of the eſtate of our childe or friend; then muſt wee with <hi>Dauid</hi> comfort our ſelues, and ſay, <hi>But now he is dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt and weepe? can I bring him back againe, I ſhall goe to him, but he ſhall not returne to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let them mourne for their dead, that know not the hope of the dead, and ſuppoſe them extinct that are departed. But let them that in the Schoole of Chriſt haue learned what is the condition &amp; hope of the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how their ſoules doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently liue with Chriſt, and that their bodies ſhall be raiſed vp in glorie at the laſt day, let them reioyce on the behalfe of their dead, <note place="margin">Amos 8.10.</note> and throw off that burden of ſorrow, which is ſo heauie vnto them. But you will ſay he was my onely childe, and therefore his death muſt needs be grieuous. <note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> Indeed the death of an onely childe is very great and grieuous to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and a cauſe of great heauineſſe and lamentation: yet remember that <hi>Abraham</hi> was readie to haue ſacrificed his only ſonne <hi>Iſaak,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22.3.10.</note> the promiſed ſeede, at Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Iohn 3.26.</note> And God gaue his only Sonne Chriſt Ieſus to death for our ſaluation. And to comfort you to the full, as <hi>Elka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:1365:127"/> ſaid to <hi>Anna,</hi> ſo alſo much more may the Lord ſay to vs, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Am not I better to you then ten ſonnes?</hi> Then though hee bee your only childe, and all that you haue, there is no iuſt cauſe of complaint and griefe, ſeeing the Lord hath taken but his owne, and alſo ſeeing in his taking of him, you giue him but as your pledge and earneſt, to binde vnto you the right of that inheritance, that you expect, or as your feoffee in truſt gone before to take poſſeſſion, and keepe a place for you in heauen.</p>
               <p>Truſt me now, or elſe the time will come when you ſhall truſt me, that you haue cauſe, and cauſe againe to lament and mourne, not for them, who dying in the Lord, are happie with the Lord, and reſt from all their labours and miſeries, but as Chriſt ſaid in the Goſpell to the woman that followed him, <hi>Weepe not for me, but weepe for your ſelues and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23.28.</note> ſo we for our ſelues and our children; for hauing been ſafe by them, and ſtrengthned through them, they are taken away from the plague, wee lye open to it, and it commeth the faſter, becauſe they which kept it from vs, are remoued. And the greater our loſſe is, the greater is their gaine, and the more cauſe haue we to ſorrow for our ſelues, although to reioyce on their behalfe, and to lament for our ſinnes, that haue depriued vs of their graces, goodneſſe, prayers and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly company; and let vs follow them in their faith, vertue, pietie, godlineſſe and good workes.</p>
               <p>And yet, if for all this, their loſſe, &amp; the want of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence be grieuous vnto you, and that you ſtill deſire their preſence, and would ſee them: let me ſpeake to you, as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> did to ſome that were ſo affected.

               <p>It is written of <hi>Ierome,</hi> that when he had read the life and death of <hi>Hillarion,</hi> and ſaw that after he had liued religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he died moſt comfortably and happily, ſaid, Well, <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion</hi> ſhall be the champion whom I will imitate: euen ſo let
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1365:128"/> vs ſay with <hi>Ierome,</hi> Well, this godly friend of ours, which is deceaſed, ſhall be our champion, whom we will imitate, we will follow his chaſtitie, iuſtice, pietie and godlineſſe. And ſo, if you endeauour and doe, ſay and performe, you ſhall be ſure to enioy that in future time, which hee poſſeſſeth in the preſent, that is, heauenly and eternall bliſſe and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
               <p>What Pilgrime doth not make ſpeed to returne home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his owne countrie? Who haſting to ſaile homewards, doth not wiſh for a proſperous winde, that he may ſpeedily embrace his long deſired friends and parents? and what are we but pilgrimes on earth: what is our country, but Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, who are our parents, but the Patriarkes? Why make we not haſt to runne vnto them, that we may ſee our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, ſalute our parents? an infinite number of acquaintance expect vs there; our parents, brethren, ſiſters, friends, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, kindred, that are alreadie ſecure of their owne immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, but yet ſollicitous for our ſafetie, what ioy will it bee to ſee, to embrace them?</p>
               <p>Conclude then with your heart, that you will bee ſtrong againſt ſuch loſſes, and pray to the giuer of ſtrength that you may be ſtrong, and leaue your loſſes to the Lord your God, that hath gained them, bleſſed for them, bleſſed for you, with many thankes for euer and euer.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ouching the caſes wherein it is vnlawful to deſire death, they may be reduced prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally into three.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, if God can bee more honoured by our life, then by our death, then in ſuch a caſe, it is altogether vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deſie death, but rather on the contrary we are to deſire and pray for life. For which purpoſe wee haue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers examples in the holy Scriptures to warrant the ſame, as of King <hi>Dauid,</hi> and king <hi>Ezechiah. Dauid</hi> bewayled himſelfe in many of his Pſalmes, that If God tooke him away, he ſhould lacke occaſion to honour &amp; prayſe him, as he was wont to doe whileſt he was amongſt men; and therefore hee deſired longer life, that he might ſet forth the honour of God amongſt the people. <hi>Returne O Lord</hi> (ſayth he) <note place="margin">Pſal. 6.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>deliuer my Soule, O ſaue mee for thy mercies ſake; for in death there is no remembrance of thee, in the graue who ſhall giue thee thank?</hi> Againe, <note place="margin">Pſa. 30.8.9.10</note> 
                  <hi>I cryed vnto thee O Lord, &amp;c. When I go down into the pitte, ſhall the duſt praiſe thee? &amp;c</hi> Againe, <note place="margin">Pſal 88 9 10 11 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Mine eye mourneth by reaſon of affliction, &amp;c. ſhall the dead riſe and praiſe thee?</hi> And againe, <note place="margin">Pſal 118.17.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhall not dye but liue, and declare the workes of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezechiah</hi> bewayled himſelfe, <note place="margin">Eſa. 38.18.19.20.</note> when hee heard the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1365:129"/> meſſage of death, and praied for longer life, knowing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that God ſhould bee more honoured by his life, then by his death: And therefore ſayth hee, <hi>The graue cannot prayſe thee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus may euery godly Chriſtian deſire life, and not death, to this end onely that God thereby may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: But yet in this caſe, although it be vnlawfull to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire death, ſo long as God may bee glorified by our Life, yet in praying for life to this end, we muſt referre all to Gods good wil and pleaſure. Therfore if any wil obiect &amp; ſay, I might in my place by mine endeauour (ſuch as it is) for the time to come; further profite the Church of God, and greatly honour him; for this end therefore, I could wiſh that the ſpace of a longer life might be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> As the Lord ſayd vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 8.18.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Whereas it was in thine heart to build an houſe to my name, thou didſt well that it was in thine heart. Neuertheleſſe thou ſhalt not build the houſe, but thy ſonne which ſhall come forth of thy loynes, he ſhall build the houſe vnto my name.</hi> Euen ſo it may bee ſayde to thee, that whereas it is in thine heart to glorifie God, and to profite his Church; and therefore thou couldeſt wiſh, that the ſpace of a longer life might be granted vnto thee; to that end thou doeſt well that it is in thine heart to doe ſo. Neuertheleſſe, all this muſt bee commended to Gods diſpoſing, that is, how long God wil haue thee to remaine in health and life for his glorie, and for the good of his Church. For hee that hath furniſhed thee with the giftes of teaching or exhortation, or any other good gift for the glory of God and good of his Church, he doth know how to furniſh others alſo with the ſame, when thou art gone; and as God would not let <hi>Dauid</hi> build his Temple, but did reſerue it to be performed afterward by <hi>Salomon;</hi> ſo God for ſome ſecret cauſe, will not haue that good worke furniſhed by thee, but reſerueth it for ſome other time, and ſome other perſon. Therefore if thou art ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1365:129"/> with the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">Philip. 1.23.</note> that thou doeſt not know which of theſe thou ſhouldeſt chuſe, hauing a deſire to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and to be with Chriſt (which is better for thee) or to abide in the fleſh, which is more profitable for the church; Know that to dye, is aduantage vnto thee; but to liue, is aduantage to the Church. <hi>No man of vs</hi> (ſayeth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <note place="margin">Rom. 14.7.8</note> 
                  <hi>liueth to himſelſf, and no man dyeth to himſelfe; for whether we liue, wee liue to the Lord, (to the end that wee may glorifie him,</hi> and gaine more ſoules to him in the Church) <hi>or whether we dye, we dye to the Lord, (that we may obey his Fatherly will, calling vs out of our Station.) Whether therefore we liue or dye, we are the Lords,</hi> (that moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, gentle, and mercifull Lord, <hi>From whoſe loue, neyther life nor death can ſeparate vs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.38.39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thou haſt hitherto obeyed the will of the Lord moſt faithfully, ſpending thy ſeruices on the Church militant; obey him further moſt readily, embracing his will, that calles thee to the ſociety of the Church triumphant.</p>
               <p>Thou art rightly carefull out of charity for the encreaſe of the church, notwithſtanding thou oughteſt out of faith to commit the care of gouerning, teaching and conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſame vnto God.</p>
               <p>There is nothing heere more wholeſome, nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor more conformable to pietie, then for a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne himſelfe wholy to the will of God; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the full power of diſpoſing our life and death to him with godlie prayers. And one of theſe two thinges, we may vndoubtedly hope for; that eyther hee will giue vs that which wee aske, or that which hee knoweth to be more profitable; <hi>Delight thy ſelfe in the Lord</hi> (ſayeth the Pſalmiſt) <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and he ſhall giue thee the deſires of thine heart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy way vnto the Lord, truſt alſo in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is altogether vnlawfull to deſire death through impatience, in that wee cannot haue our owne willes, wiſhes, and deſires. <note place="margin">Gen. 31.1</note> In which caſe <hi>Rachell</hi> offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1365:130"/> for ſeeing that ſhee bare <hi>Iacob</hi> no children, ſhee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied her ſiſter, <note place="margin">Exo. 16.23.</note> and ſayde vnto <hi>Iacob, Giue me children, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lſe I dye.</hi> In like caſe alſo the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> offended, who murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſaid, <hi>Would to God wee had dyed by the hand of the Lord in the Land of Egypt, when we ſate by the fleſh pots. &amp; did eate bread to the ful.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 11.10.</note> In this caſe <hi>Moſes</hi> offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded who ſaid vnto the Lord; <hi>Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy ſeruant and wherfore haue not I found fauor in thy ſight, that thou layeſt all the burden of this people vpon me? Whence ſhould I haue fleſh to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iue vnto all this people? For they weepe vnto me ſaying giue vs fleſh that we may eate, I am not able to beare all this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alone, becauſe it is too heauie for me, and if thou deale thus with me, kill me (I pray thee) out of hand, &amp;c</hi> In this caſe King <hi>Dauid</hi> offended, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 18.33.</note> when hee hearing of the death of his rebellious and wicked ſonne <hi>Abſolon,</hi> being much moued, he ſaid mourning; <hi>Would to God I had dyed for thee O Abſolon my ſonne my ſonne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this caſe alſo the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> greatly offended, for when God ſaw the workes of the Nineuites, that they turned from their euill way at the preaching of <hi>Ionah,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ionah. 3.10.</note> and that then God repented of the euill that he had ſayd for their deſtruction, and did it not. <hi>Ionah</hi> is ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, <note place="margin">Ionah. 4.1.2.3,</note> that he beſought the Lord to take his life from him, ſaying, It was better for him to dye, then to liue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is al ogether vnlawfull to deſire death, to bee reuenged vpon our owne ſelues, which is moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, barbarous, and moſt vnnaturall for one to laye violent hands vpon himſelfe, to whom he is tied &amp; bound by all bonds: for one to rend his owne body and ſoule in ſunder (which God hath coupled together, and no man but hee muſt ſeparate) is a ſinne moſt horrible and fearefull, and breakes the bonds of God and Nature, and this no Beaſt (be it neuer ſo ſauage and cruell) will do. Sometime they will teare, rend, and gore one another; but no beaſt was euer in ſuch extreame paine and miſery, as
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1365:130"/> to rage &amp; ſeeke to depriue himſelf of life. For the cauſe that one growes to this (more then beaſtly) rage and cruelty, againſt his owne body, is firſt a monſtrous pride, that hee will not be at all, vnleſſe hee may be as hee liſt himſelfe, he will not ſubmit himſelfe to Gods will Secondly, that he hath not any beliefe in God, nor euer lookes for a good iſſue out of troubles. Thirdly, it is noted of moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſperate perſons, that who firſt were barbarous, and cruell to others, at length they turned the point of crueltie againſt themſelues. And this was the ſinne of the heathen people which knew not God; for they taught and practiſed voluntarie death, and ſelfe-murther, whereby men might free themſelues at their owne will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from all euill of paine. And yet ſome of them (as <hi>Plato</hi> that approached ſo neere to a Chriſtian truth in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points) maintained alſo the ſelfe ſame murder; yet he did appoint ſome publike ſhame and infamy in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of buriall, for thoſe that kil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed themſelues. Yea ſome others of them, hauing gone further (as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergil</hi>) who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dangers therof, (as namely, that it is puniſhed in the life to come) hath placed thoſe that offend in that kind in Hell, and that in ſuch torments as they wiſh themſelues backe againe, and vpon that condition, would be content to endure all the torments, miſeries and calamities inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this life.</p>
               <p>So that this ſelfe-murther is not to auoyde miſerie, but to change miſerie; yea, and to change the leſſe for the greater miſery, &amp; (as we vſe to ſpeak) leap out of the frying panne into the fire; who are in a very wofull caſe after this life, dying out of Gods fauour, as they needes muſt that thus make away themſelues.</p>
               <p>In the whole Hiſtorie of the Bible that containeth the Records belonging to the Church of God, and to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that pretend to haue any knowledge of good; of how many hath he heard or read that did ſo? and what were they? In the firſt age of the world that laſted from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1365:131"/> to the floud, ſixeteene hundred fifty and ſixe yeares, wee reade of much wickedneſſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 4.8.23.</note> how <hi>Cain</hi> vnnaturally killed his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> how <hi>Lamech</hi> tranſgreſſed Gods ordinance for marriage, and gloried in his owne cruelty. Wee reade of the carnall licentiouſneſſe of the men of the beſt line, <note place="margin">Gen. 6.2.</note> how the ſonnes of God ſaw the daughters of men that they were fayre, and tooke them wiues of all that they liſted. Yea, of the whole race of mankind we reade, that the earth was corrupt before God, and their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo vile in his fight, that hee repented that hee made man, <note place="margin">Gen. 6.11.12.</note> and he brought a deluge vpon the earth, wherewith hee deſtroyed all liuing Creatures, in whoſe noſtrels was the breath of life. And in all this time it is not read, that any grew vnto this height of wickedneſſe to incroach ſo farre vpon the right of God, as moſt vnnaturally, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to kill himſelfe.</p>
               <p>In ſo many yeares the Deuil that was a murderer from the beginning, could not preuayle ſo far amongſt the moſt wicked, as to perſwade any to lay violent handes vpon himſelfe. This wickednes was then vnknowne from the floud to the natiuity of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for the ſpace of two thouſand, three hundred and eleuen yeares. Wee reade of moſt horrible wickedneſſe of bloudy warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Nations, of the tyranny of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> of the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> of the vncleannes of the <hi>Sodomites;</hi> of the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Sichemites,</hi> of the tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> of the ſin of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> of the rebellion of <hi>Korah,</hi> of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of <hi>Balaam,</hi> of the fornication of <hi>Zimry,</hi> and of infinite vngodlineſſe in euery age of man, in euery gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but of this kind of vnnaturalneſſe, for men to lay violent hands vpon themſelues, wee haue very few exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 3 1.4.5</note> of which <hi>Saul</hi> is one, who fell vpon his own Sword, and killed himſelfe, and his Armour-bearer by his Lordes example incouraged, did the like vnto himſelfe. And not many yeares after, <hi>Achitophel</hi> the great Counſeller, that followed <hi>Abſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 17.23</note> vpon diſcontent left <hi>Abſolon,</hi> went home
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1365:131"/> to his owne houſe and hanged himſelfe. <note place="margin">1 Kings 16,18</note> We reade of a fourth, named <hi>Zinry,</hi> that being beſieged in <hi>Tirzah,</hi> and not able to defend himſelfe and the place, went into the Kings Pallace, &amp; ſetting the houſe on fire, burnt himſelfe. And theſe are all that I remember mentioned in the olde Teſtament, that are guilty of this impiety. <note place="margin">Iudg: 16,30.</note> For we are not to number <hi>Sampſon</hi> amongſt them, whoſe purpoſe was not to kill himſelfe, but to execute the iudgement of God vpon the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> which was a worke of his calling, in the faithfull and zealous performance whereof, hee loſt his life.</p>
               <p>The Hiſtory of <hi>Razis</hi> that fell on his ſword, <note place="margin">2, Mach: 14.41,42.</note> and ſlew himſelfe, I wittinglie paſſe ouer, leauing the credite of that Hiſtory to the authority of the Writer; whom yet if you adde to the former, the number is not much encreaſed by him. So few they were in ſo many yeares, with whom the ancient murderer could preuayle, to make them enemies of their owne liues. And if we conſider what manner of perſons they were, with whom he did ſo farre preuayle; their wickedneſſe will ſerue to warne any man that hath any one dramme of piety, wiſedome, or care of his credit, not to put himſelfe in ranke with them. <hi>Saul</hi> was a man enuious, trayterous, perfidious, cruell and prophane, who being bloudily minded againſt the Prieſtes of God, and againſt <hi>Dauid</hi> Gods owne annointed, he made his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſo fierce and cruell, as that it ſet vpon himſelfe, and hee became his owne Butcher. Whoſe Armour-bearer verified the Prouerbe, <hi>Like Maſter, like man.</hi> As for <hi>Achitophel</hi> he was a great Stateſman, but withall a great Traytor; he was verie wiſe in matters pertayning to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but therewithall very wicked; he aſſiſted the ſubiect againſt the King, therein was treaſon; the Sonne againſt the Father, that was vnnaturall; a wicked, vngodlie, proud ſonne againſt a godly father, euen holy <hi>Dauid,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in moſt impious treaſon. <hi>Zimri</hi> likewiſe was a traytor, who ſlew <hi>Elah</hi> his Lord and Maſter, and inuaded the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1365:132"/> Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such were the men, with whom the ancient Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer preuailed in three and twenty hundred yeares; few in number, and men of moſt wicked hearts and liues. And ſhall any imagine or thinke to match himſelfe with ſuch forlorne Wretches? In vvickedneſſe ſo rare will hee bee ſo forward, and with men ſo vile will hee ioyne?</p>
               <p>For the time after the comming of our Lord Ieſus in the fleſh, we haue record in the ſcriptures for ſeuenty years. In which time we read of much vvickedneſſe, of the rage of the Iewes, in crucifying and killing the Lord Ieſus, the Lord of life, of the perſecution of <hi>Saul,</hi> wherein <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſtoned; the perſecution of <hi>Herod,</hi> wherin Saint <hi>Iames</hi> was ſlaine vvith the ſword; of the malice of the Iewes in euery place, forbidding the Apoſtles to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to the Gentiles, and of their endleſſe malice againſt <hi>Paul</hi> being conuerted, and become a vvitneſſe of Ieſus.</p>
               <p>And amongeſt all the inraged ſinners of this time, in vvhom the Prince of this world exerciſed his power moſt imperiouſly; We read but of one that layde violent hands vpon himſelfe, euen <hi>Iudas</hi> the Apoſtle, and hee is marked out by the names of a <hi>Traytor, a Deuill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Child of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So rare is this iniquitie in compariſon of other ſins, and ſo notoriouſly and incurablie euill are thoſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of other ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And ſhall any one ſinner bee ſo wicked, as reſolued to increaſe this number, and to match, if not exceede theſe men.</p>
               <p>Let the rareneſſe of the ſinne, (wherein the Deuill ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue ſome modeſty, as fearing to allure too many to ſuch extreame wickedneſſe and madneſſe) and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame incurable iniquity of the men, as if the Deuill thought it not fitte to tempt any to ſo geeat wickedneſſe, but ſuch as had already outrunne all his allurementes by their owne forwardneſſe in ſinne; Let thoſe thinges ſtay the reſolution of any ſinner, and make him feare to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute

Nay more then this, ſayth Saint <hi>Bernard, mirabilis ſocietas,</hi> in man hee hath made a wonderfull ſociety; for in him, Heauen and earth Maieſtie and baſeneſſe, Excellency and pouerty hee hath matched together.

This is a daungerous errour, wherein the Deuill the ancient Murderer hath beene their Counſellour, the Giuer of Life neuer perſwaded thereunto, the very fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth from what head that ſinne came, euen from him that laboureth by all meanes the deſtuction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1365:138"/> caſe ſhould make away himſelfe! What may bee thought of the eſtate of ſuch a one? Maſter <hi>Foxe</hi> in his booke of Acts and Monuments, <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, 1708. 1709.</note> in the lamentable Storie of Maſter <hi>Iames Hales</hi> a Iudge, ſayth, that this iudge graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſomething by the aſſault and craftie perſwaſion of <hi>Stephen Gardiner</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Winchiſter,</hi> and of the reſt of the perſecuting Prelates, beeing by theyr greatneſſe and importunitie ouercome, did ſhortly after call him ſelfe to better remembrance, and with extreame griefe and anguiſh of heart, hee was ready with his Pen-knife to haue killed himſelfe in priſon, and had no doubt ſo done, had not the mercifull prouidence of the Lord reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued him miraculouſly at that time. After that <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> hearing that hee had ſore wounded himſelfe, taketh occaſion thereby to blaſpheme the Goſpell, calling it openly in the Starre-Chamber, the Doctrine of Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: But the ſayd Iudge within a while after reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of thoſe wounds, and deliuered out of priſon, gets himſelfe home to his houſe in Kent, where hee eyther for the greatneſſe of his ſorrow, or for lacke of good counſell or for that hee would auoide the neceſſity of hearing Maſſe, hauing all things ſet in an order, a good while before that appertained to his Teſtament, caſting himſelfe into a ſhallow riuer, was drowned therin; which was in Ianuary or February, 2555. which vnhappy chance of this ſo worthy a Iudge (as M. <hi>Foxe</hi> ſayth) was ſurely the cauſe of great ſorrow and griefe to all good men, and it gaue occaſion beſides to ſome Diuines, to doubt with themſelues whether he were reprobate or ſaued. Of which matter ſaith he, it is not for me to determine. Our Iudge is his Iudge, who will lay all thinges open when the time commeth. This in the meane time is certaine, that the deede of the man ought in no wiſe to bee allowed; If wittingly, I diſcommend his reaſon; if in a phrenzie, as one out of his wit, then doe I greatly lament, and pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty his caſe. Yet notwithſtanding ſeeing Gods iudgements
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1365:138"/> be ſecret, and wee be likewiſe in doubt vpon what intent he did thus puniſh himſelfe; nor any man can be certaine whether he repented or not before the laſt breath, I think their opinion herein is more indifferent, who doe rather diſallow the example of the dead, then deſpayre any way of his ſaluation. Otherwiſe, if we will adiudge all theſe to hell that haue departed the World after this ſort, how many examples haue we in the firſt perſecutions of the Church of thoſe men and women, who being regiſtred in the Works of worthy Writers; haue notwithſtanding their prayſe and commendation. For what ſhall wee thinke of thoſe young men, who being ſought for to doe ſacrifice to heathen Idols, did caſt down themſelues headlong and brake their neckes to auoyde ſuch horrible pollution of themſelues? What ſhall I ſay of thoſe Virgins of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> who to the end they might not defile themſelues with vncleanneſſe, and with Idolatrie, through the perſwaſion of their mother, caſting themſelues headlong into a riuer, (together with their mother) did for doe themſelues, though not in the ſame water; yet after the ſame manner of drowning as this M. <hi>Hales</hi> did.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of other two ſiſters, which for the ſelfe ſame quarrell did violently throw themſelues headlong into the Sea, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth recorde? In whom though perchance, there was leſſe confidence to beare out the paines that ſhould be miniſtred of the wicked vnto them; yet that their good deſire to keepe their faith and religion vnſpotted, was commended and prayſed. Another like example of death is mentioned by <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in another Virgin likewiſe, whoſe name is expreſſed in <hi>Ierome</hi> to bee <hi>Braeſſila Diraehima,</hi> who to keepe her Virginity, fayned her ſelfe to be a Witch, and ſo conuenting with the yong man which went about to deflowre her, pretended that ſhee would giue him an hearbe which ſhould preſerue him from all kind of weapons, and ſo to proue it in her ſelfe, layde the hearbe vpon her owne throat, bidding

               <p>Touching the Caſes wherein it is lawfull to deſire death, they may bee reduced principally into fiue.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that if God can bee more honoured and glorified by our death then by our life; then in ſuch a caſe it is lawfull to deſire death. <note place="margin">Iudg. 16.28.29.30.</note> In which caſe <hi>Sampſon</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death, knowing wel therby, that he ſhould ſlay more of the vncircumciſed Philiſtines, the enemies of God, at his death, then he ſlue in his life. In this caſe <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſeruant of God deſired to dye; yea, he went further; for hee deſired not a temporall but an eternall death for the glory of God in the ſaluation of his people. For when <hi>Moſes</hi> perceyued that the Lord was greatly offended with the people for making and worſhipping the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1365:140"/> Calfe, and that the Lords wrath waxed hote againſt them, and that hee meant to conſume them for the ſame: <note place="margin">Exod 32.31.32.33.</note> It is ſayd that <hi>Moſes</hi> returned to the Lord and ſayde; <hi>Oh this people haue ſinned a great ſin, and haue made them Gods of gold: yet now if thou wilt forgiue their ſinne, and if not, blot mee I pray thee out of the booke which thou haſt written,</hi> Alſo in this caſe the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> went as farre as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> in deſiring the ſame death, for the like cauſe as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, which was for the glory of God in the ſaluation of his people.

Well knowing with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that they ſhould ſlay more at their death, then they ſlue in their Life; as firſt, that they ſhould ſlay their laſt enemie by death, which is not ſlaine but by dying: And ſecondly, that by dying they ſhould kill the ſpawne of all enmitie, ſinne that cauſeth death; and thirdly, they knew that God ſhould be more glorified, and honoured by their death, then hee could be by their life, in that it would thereby bee an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of daunting his enemies, and of the increaſing and flouriſhing of his Church and Children. For the death of the Martyrs was the ſeed of Gods Church, <note place="margin">Acts and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents. 113.</note> In which reſpect M. <hi>Foxe</hi> in his Acts and Monuments ſayth, that in old time Martyrdome was more deſired then Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes be now.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it is lawfull to deſire death in reſpect of the wicked, through zeale to Gods glory, to the end that wee may bee freede from their ſociety, whereby wee might not bee eye-witneſſes, nor eare-witneſſes of theyr dayly blaſpheming and diſhonouring of God. In which caſe <hi>Rebecka</hi> deſired death; <note place="margin">Gen. 26.34.35.</note> for when <hi>Eſau</hi> had taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly wiues, it is ſayd, that <hi>they were a griefe of mind vnto Iſaack and her, becauſe they knew that God was greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thereby:</hi>

               <p>Who can expreſſe what a griefe it is to the childe of God to bee incloſed and compaſſed about with wicked and vngodly miſcreants, by whom God is all the day long blaſphemed and diſhonoured?

It would make a mans heart to bleed to heare &amp; conſider, how ſwearing, blaſpheming, curſed ſpeaking, rayling, ſlandering, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, contending, ieaſting, mocking, ſcoffing, flattering, lying, diſſembling, vaine, corrupt, filthy ſcolding, ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, looſe and idle talking, that ouerflow in all places, ſo that men that feare God, had better bee any where, then in the company of moſt men.

               <p>
                  <hi>Lot</hi> was fore vexed and grieued with the vncleane conuerſation of the wicked: and therefore it is ſayd, that the Lord deliuered iuſt <hi>Lot,</hi> vexed with the filthy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the wicked, <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.7.8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>As the World in all ages heretofore hath not knowne the pure and ſtraight paths of God, ſo in theſe preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill dayes of ours, the true and right Profeſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie is counted of many Puritaniſme and preciſeneſſe, phantaſticall affectation of ſingularitie, and popularitie, and hipocriſie. True it is indeede, that as there are true Preachers, and true Beleeuers, ſo Sathan ſtirres vp coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits, that haue an outward ſhew and reſemblance of them, but are not purged from their inwarde filthineſſe. <note place="margin">Pro. 30.12.</note> Theſe are they that Worldlings ſtumble at, concluding thus; Euen ſo are they all; therefore their profeſſion is but a kind of Sect, and to follow the common courſe &amp; practiſe of the world, is the ſureſt and ſafeſt way. And here Sathan hath his deſire. Againe, if any godly man that hath alwayes made conſcience of his wayes ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, although of meere infirmity, or occaſioned by ſome ſtrong temptation, but yet ſo, as hee may iuſtly be taxed;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1365:142"/> why then the matter is out of all doubt, both he and all his ranke are hypocrites, and none elſe. Such is the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the world, and their preiudicate opinion of the children of God. But to you that are of this vncharitable opinion, giue mee leaue to ſpeake thus much: You boaſt your ſelues to bee the children of God, and the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, though careleſſe of your wayes; but as for others, who make conſcience of their wayes, you make mockes on them with your mouthes, and you deuiſe termes for them, to make them accounted factious, ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, hypocrites, and I know not what; they are your ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſtockes and taunting Prouerbes; Concerning which ſect, <note place="margin">Act. 28.22,</note> we know, that euery where it is ſpoken againſt; but where is your deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? where is your zeale, where is your repentance, where is your feruency, ſobrietie, prayer, thankſgiuing, humilitie?

But for a concluſion, let me leaue this as a bone for you to gnaw on, That ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes ſhall euer bee caſt before the feet of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yet ſhall the Lanthorn of Gods word ſhine vnto them to guide them without ſtumbling or erring: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſtumble they will, and fall downe euen to the breaking of their neckes; for their owne wickednes blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them; yea and they wilfully out of the hardneſſe of their hearts cloſe their eyes againſt the wayes of truth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wayes of error, death and deſtruction, are more pleaſant vnto them,</p>
               <p>Furthermore, woe ſhall bee to them that wrong by

We are commaunded in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, <note place="margin">2. Theſſ. 3.6.</note> to <hi>withdraw our ſelues from euery brother that walketh diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.</hi> All this may be done when we loue the men, and hate the vices, when we ſuffer them to haue no quietneſſe in their ſinnes, and yet liue quietly, and offer quietneſſe to themſelues: Hee that will wholy abandon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of them that are euill, muſt (as the Apoſtle ſayth) get himſelfe out of the world; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.10.</note> and therefore Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayeth fitlie to this purpoſe; Wee ought to flie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of wicked men, in reſpect of priuate fellowſhippe, and not, in reſpect of publike communion, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our hearts and affections, then with our bodies and outward actions; wee may not hate our brother, but loue him; yet if we loue the Lord, <note place="margin">Leuit. 19.17. Pſal. 97.16. Rom. 12.18.</note> wee muſt hate that which is euill; where the Apoſtle ſayth; <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lyeth in you, liue peaceably with all men.</hi> We may haue no peace with the manners, yet we muſt liue peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with the men. Thus then in a word out of the words of the Apoſtle, the controuerſie may be decided: If it bee poſſible, ſo farre forth as may ſtand with our faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, as much as lyeth in you, let vs doe our part, and performe our beſt endeauour to liue peaceably; if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1365:144"/> haue peace, yet let vs liue peaceably with all men, with the bad to reforme them, with the good to conform our ſelues vnto them, with our enemies to ſhunne them; with our friends to keepe them.</p>
               <p>And here is comfort for the children of God, whom the wicked thruſt out of their company; and would (if they could) thruſt out of the world, becauſe of their conſcience to God, <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.20.</note> and becauſe they follow the thing that good is. And hereof it is that the Wiſeman ſaieth, that <hi>Hee that is vpright in the way,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 29.27.</note> 
                  <hi>is abomination to the wicked.</hi> And hence it is alſo that the Prophet ſayeth; <hi>Hee that departeth from euill, maketh himſelfe a prey, and the Lord ſaw it, and it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay 59.15.</note> And though they bee not accepted, where euill men beare ſway (which is no diſparagement to them but glorie, nor loſſe, but gaine) yet they are eſteemed of the good, and admired of the euill, though not followed of them. Doe the wicked hate them? they ſhall looſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by ſuch hatred, for God and good men will loue them. Will not the vnrighteous haue any fellowſhippe with them? It is ſo much the better for them; for they are in leſſe daunger of corruption, and in more poſſibility of grace &amp; goodnes. And where me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be euil auoid them, Chriſt &amp; his thouſands of Angels wil ſtick cloſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11.38.</note> Thoſe Worthies of whom wee reade in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, were moſt cruelly dealt with all, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in the World. Of whom the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; for the wicked did driue them out of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by ſharpe perſecutions into deſarts, mountaines, and holes of the earth. But they were worthy, and had farre better company, hauing a kind of fellowſhip with Chriſt, and all the Saints that were gone before them. So, for the faithfull that now liue, if the wicked and vngodly make no more of them then of the filth of the World, and as of the of ſcouring of all things (as the Apoſtles ſpeaketh) it is becauſe they are too good to liue amongſt them, and too precious to be caſt before ſwine, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4 13.</note> that ſo treade and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is lawfull to deſire death in reſpect of our ſinnes, to the end we might not offend God any more by ſinning. And what a miſerie and bondage it is to bee in ſubiection to ſin, may appeare by the moſt earneſt and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayer of the bleſſed Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> vvho fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the waight and heauie burden thereof, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.7.8.9.</note> he deſired God with earneſt zeale and feruencie, and with deepe ſighes and groanes that hee might be deliuered from it. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, after the long and lamentable complaint that the Apoſtle made of the Law that was in his members, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing againſt the law of the Spirit, and leading him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue into the law of ſinne, hee breaketh forth into this moſt patheticall exclamation. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliuer mee from the body of this death</hi> (or this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death) <hi>I thanke God through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.24.25,</note> The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> alſo feeling the heauy waight of his ſinnes, maketh his grieuous complaint and mone thereof vnto God, ſaying; <hi>There is no ſoundneſſe in my fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 38.34.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe of thine anger, neyther is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſinnes; for mine iniquities are gone ouer my head as a heauie burthen, they are too heauy for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man would inuent a torment for ſuch as feare God, and deſire to walke in newneſſe of life, and to haue part in the firſt reſurrection; hee cannot deuiſe a greater torment, then to be diſquieted with this tyranny of ſinne, and with this vnquiet &amp; vnhappy Iebuſite, euen the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and corruption of our owne fleſh; and this heauie weight of ſinne that doth cleaue and hang ſo faſt vpon vs. O happy therefore and bleſſed death that diſchargeth and
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:1365:145"/> freeth vs from ſo ſore, comberſome and cruell bondage, and from further offending of him, who dyed for our ſins. So that death freeth vs from the neceſſity of ſinning, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo brings vs to bee with Chriſt; And to deſire death in this caſe, is not a loathing to liue, but a loathneſſe to ſinne. In which caſe <hi>Iob</hi> deſired death, becauſe of his ſinnes, that he might not offend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od any more; and therefore hee ſayth; <note place="margin">Iob. 6.8.9 10.</note> 
                  <hi>O that I might haue my request, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for, euen that it would pleaſe God to destroy me, that he would let looſe his hand, and cut me off, then ſhould I yet haue comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the meane while, till we can haue our deſire in this caſe accompliſhed, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> wee muſt reſiſt and ſtriue againſt our ſinnes, that they may not raigne in our mortall bodies; and let all our endeauor and care increaſe againſt our ſins, that the force of them may be dayly weakened, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber leſſened, and all occaſions of ſinning auoyded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is lawfull to deſire death, in reſpect of the miſeries, calamities and troubles of this life; and for the preuenting of the miſeries to come. And yet this holy deſire muſt not be ſimple and abſolute, but it muſt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with certain reſpects, and with theſe reſeruations. Firſt, it muſt bee deſired ſo farre forth, as it is a meanes to put an end to all our miſeries, to all the dangers of this life, to all the corruption of nature, and to the neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Secondly, as it is a gate by which wee enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immediate fellowſhip with Chriſt and of God. And our deſire alſo for theſe endes muſt keepe it ſelfe within theſe limits; wherein two Caueats muſt bee obſerued: Firſt, it muſt not bee immoderate, exceeding the golden meane; Secondly, it muſt alwayes be with a reſeruation of Gods good pleaſure, and with an humble ſubmiſſion, and ſubiection of our willes to the will of God. For if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe be wanting, the deſire of death is defectiue, faulty and dangerous. Death frees vs from the miſeries and perils of this world, aboliſheth all preſent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1365:145"/> all future dangers, and brings vs to be with Chriſt. What man wearied with labour, deſires not reſt, what Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner toſſed vpon the ſeas, wiſheth not to come into ſafe harbour? What traueller toiled with a tedious and perilous iorney, would not willingly come to his wayes end? what ſicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accepts not health? what ſlaue imbraceth not free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? what priſoner doth not entertaine inlargement? what captiue would not welcome liberty? what husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would be euer toyling, and not at length receiue the fruit of his labour? what marchant is content to liue euer in danger by ſea and by land, amongſt Pyrats and robbers, &amp; not to come at laſt ſafe home with his wealth? And laſtly, what man hauing the reuerſion of a goodly kingdome, would be loath to receyue the poſſeſſion of it? And ſure wee are all in this caſe by reaſon of the manifold miſeries incident to vs in this world; that wee haue good cauſe to wiſh with a holy deſire to be looſed from al theſe miſeries, and to be with our Sauiour Chriſt, and in the meane time, <note place="margin">Luk. 21.19.</note> till we can haue our deſire in this caſe, <hi>Let patience poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe our ſoules.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, and laſtly it is lawfull to deſire death for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and full accompliſhment of that coniunction and vnion which wee haue in Chriſt Ieſus our head, that wee might be where he is to enioy his preſence. <hi>For we are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>members of his body, of his fleſh,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.30.</note> 
                  <hi>and of his bones</hi> that is, we are moſt ſtraightly coupled to Chriſt by the ſpirituall band of our faith; which vnion is moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; For firſt wee are vnited to his Godhead, that is not by tranſfuſion of the diuine ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but by effectual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by the manhood; and ſecondly, wee are one with his manhood, that is really and ſubſtantially, <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note> as appeareth by thoſe Similitudes by which this vnion is expreſſed in holy Scriptures; as namely, Firſt of the Vine and branches, <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.29. Rom. 11.18. Eph. 2.20. Eph. 1.23.</note> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the Bridegroome and the Bride; Thirdly, of the Oliue tree and the branches; Fourthly, of the foundation and the building; Fiftly, and ſpecially of the head &amp; mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1365:146"/> Concerning which vnion <hi>Cyril</hi> hath made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, that as two peeces of waxe moulten vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do make vp one lumpe, ſo Chriſts fleſh with our fleſh ioyned together, make vp one body which is his Church.</p>
               <p>And this coniunction and vnion which wee haue in Chriſt, is alſo ſet downe in that heauenly prayer, which our Sauiour Chriſt made vnto God his Father, at his laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well out of this world immediately before his paſſion and ſuffering; <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> where hee prayeth at large for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this vnion in vs with him. And if our Sauiour-Chriſt himſelfe did pray vnto his Father for the ful accom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pliſhment of this vnion, that wee might be where he is, for to behold his glorie, then it is lawfull for vs to deſire the ſame. And this is true loue indeed vnto Chriſt our head, to deſire to bee with him; for the propertie of true loue is an ardent and burning deſire to obtaine that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued. And as a woman that loueth her husband vnfained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot be content with any loue token ſhee receyueth from him in his abſence, but longeth and wiſheth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth more and more till ſhee receyue himſelfe; euen ſo, the Soule which is wounded with the loue of Ieſus her mercifull husband, hath continuall deſire to be with him. I grant euery token ſent from him brings comfort, but no contentment till ſhe enioy him. If the loue of men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Apoſtle to ſay to the Corinthians, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12:14:</note> 
                  <hi>It is not yours, but you I ſeeke.</hi> How much more ſhould the loue of God compell vs to ſay to our Lord Ieſus: It is not thy gift but thy ſelfe O Lord that I long for; for thou art the portion of my ſoule, ſeeing I am nothing without thee, let mee taſt the benefit of being thine, I deſire thee, &amp; not thine, for thy ſelfe, not for thy gifts; I deſire thee onely, nothing for thee, <note place="margin">Pſal. 73.25.</note> nothing with thee, nothing beſides thee.</p>
               <p>The godly Chriſtian hath ſome liuely foretaſt &amp; ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this bleſſed and happy coniunction and vnion with Chriſt, and therefore it is a griefe vnto him to be holder from him, and a ioy to remoue vnto him. But certainely

               <p>And hereof comes theſe and ſuch like complaints, <hi>As the hart panteth after the water bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

In this caſe is alſo <hi>Simon</hi> deſired death; for when the holy Ghoſt reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, that he ſhould not ſee death before he had ſeen the Lord Chriſt, after that hee had ſeene him in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>He tooke him vp in his armes, and bleſſed God and ſayde,</hi>

               <p>It is an vſuall thing in the Scripture to repreſent ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and heauenly things by bodily and earthly things, that therein as in glaſſes we may behold heauenly thinges, although obſcurely; which notwithſtanding, we cannot otherwiſe perceiue, and ſee immediatly being too glorious and vehement obiects for our eyes. Therefore as we can not behold the light of the Sunne in the Sunne, but by reflection thereof in the Moone, in the Starres, in the water, or other bright body, or elſe by refraction thereof in the miſtie ayre; ſo the ſoule while it is in the body hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſeeth, vnderſtandeth, imagineth with the body, and in a bodily manner, and therefore is not capable of ſuch hearing, ſeeing, vnderſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imagining as it ſhall bee when it is ſeparate from the body; hence it is, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſayth- <note place="margin">1.

               <p>God cauſeth (ſayth Saint <hi>Ciprian</hi>) the Sunne to riſe and ſet in order, the ſeaſons to obey vs, the elements to ſerue vs, the windes to blow, the ſpring to flow, the corn to grow, <note place="margin">Pſ. 147.18.</note> the fruites to ſhew, the gardens and orchardes to fructifie, the woods to raſtle with leaues, the meadowes to ſhine with varietie of graſſe and flowers, And <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe</hi> very excellently handling the ſame point with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> further ſhewes, that God hath in a ſorte made the night more beautifull then the day, by infinite varietie of bright and glittering ſtarres, and that hee hath beene more mindfull and mercifull then man would haue bin of himſelfe, who through the greedineſſe of the World, would haue ouertoyled himſelfe; but that God made the night of purpoſe for his repoſe and reſt. In a word, hee ſayes (and that truly) euen of theſe earthly benefites and commodities, that although we were neuer ſo vertuous; nay, if wee ſhould dye a thouſand deathes, wee ſhould not be worthie of them. And the very heathen Poet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this, could not chooſe but breake out into an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ſaying: O how many things hath God created for mans delight, &amp; heaped ioyes vpon him with a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull hand?

               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1365:150"/>
               <p>Againe, when we ſee any thing ſtrong, as the Lyon, or the Elephant, <note place="margin">Act. 40.15.16 Iob. 41.1. 1 King. 19.11.</note> whoſe ſtrength is deſcribed in the booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> or the whale, whoſe ſtrength is alſo there deſcribed; or the winde which is ſayd in the firſt booke of the Kings to bee ſo great and ſtrong, that it rent the mountaines &amp; brake in peeces the rockes; or the thunder or ſuch like, at the huge noyſe whereof (as it is ſayde in the booke of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi>) it made all the people in the Campe to feare and tremble; <note place="margin">Ex. 19 16.</note> Let vs then ſay, how ſtrong is that God, that giueth this ſtrength vnto them? Againe, when wee ſee rare beauty in men or women, or moſt glorious colours in flowers, birdes and other creatures; Let vs then ſay, how farre more beautifull and amiable is that God, that giueth this beauty and comelineſſe vnto them? And when wee taſte things that are exceeding comfortable and ſweet, as honey, and ſuch like; Let vs then ſay; how ſweete and comfortable is that GOD that giueth that ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
               <p>Now from al this let vs conclude, that if the creatures can affoord ſuch pleaſure, comfort, contentment, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; what will the Creator himſelfe doe? when we ſhall immediately enioy his glorious preſence after death? <hi>In thy preſence</hi> (ſayth the Pſalmiſt) <note place="margin">Pſal 16.11.</note>

               <p>Surely this world compared to the world to come, is as it were but a little village to the greateſt and moſt ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious City: nay, it is but as it were a gatehouſe, or Porters lodge to the moſt wide, glorious and magnificent Pallace of the greateſt Prince in the World; and if the Gatehouſe bee ſo fayre, how fayre and glorious is the Pallace it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Moreouer, conſider what great ods there is between Gods mediate and immediate preſence to enioy him in the creatures, and to enioy him in himſelfe. The creatures, yea the moſt excellent creatures, are as it were but a vayle or curtaine drawne between God and vs, which vayle or
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1365:150"/> curtaine being drawne aſide, wee ſhall ſee God face to face; and then how glorious will that ſight bee? And though we know not what it is to behold the face of God; yet herein conſiſteth the higheſt degree of our happineſſe. <note place="margin">Iſa. 33.17.</note> Therefore are the ioyes of the Saints in heauen <hi>ſuper ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiue,</hi> becauſe theyr eyes doe alwayes behold their King in the excellency of his beauty and glory. It is a pleaſing ſight and delightſome to the eye to behold the Sunne, but that is (ſayth <hi>Bernard</hi>) the true and only ioy indeed, which is conceyued from the Creator, not from the creature. <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> leaped in his mothers wombe, <note place="margin">Luk. 1.41.</note> when but the mother of his Maker came neere vnto him.

               <p>Wee are to conſider, that there is a twofold viſion or ſight of God; the one, called by ſome of the learned <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio viae,</hi> the ſight of the way, and means that bringeth home to God; the other <hi>viſio patriae,</hi> the ſight of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Touching the firſt kind of the ſight of God, which is termed <hi>viſio viae,</hi> or (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) in a glaſſe darkly, in a word this ſight conſiſteth in true faith and knowledge of God.

               <p>For the firſt; their ſpirites and ſoules ſhall behold and ſee with great comfort and ioy the bleſſed Angels, and Spirites of all the faithfull departed: They ſhall ſee the bright Court of Angels, <note place="margin">Math. 18.10.</note> Cherubins &amp; Seraphins, alwaies beholding the face of our father which is in heauen, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the Dyetie, and euer preſſing to doe his will, faithfully, ſpeedily, willingly, neuer wearie of watching, becauſe they are neuer wearie of well-doing.

As they before them haue done, ſo ſhall they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into their reſt, as into a retiring Campe after the day of battell. This is the greateſt ioy vpon the firſt ſight. And if (as <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſayth) to ſee the Deuill and euill Spirits, bee a horrible puniſhment, and a kind of hell, then to ſee good Angels and good Spirites muſt be a great ioy, and the beginning and entrance into heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 45.1.</note> The ſecond is that corporall and bodily beholding of our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, ſtanding at the right hand of God the Father, <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.</note> and his comfortable face and countenance fayrer then the ſonnes of men, and whome the very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells deſire to behold, and whereby in their Spirites the

                  <hi>Come foorth O yee daughters of Sion, and behold the King Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon with the Crowne.</hi> To ſee then this true <hi>Salomon,</hi> more great then <hi>Salomon,</hi> euen our Redeemer, thus ſtanding crowned in glory, and haue acceſſe to him, muſt needes bee a ſecond, and higher meaſure of ioy to the beholders.

Oh what ioy and greater ioy is it then to ſee Chriſt Ieſus thus crowned with glory in Gods Kingdome at home?</p>
               <p>When the Wiſe-men came a farre iourney, ſeeking Chriſt, anſt found him new borne, lying moſt meanely &amp; baſely in a Cratch amongſt the beaſts; yet did they reioice, ſeeing him in the Cratch, and did offer to him.</p>

               <p>The third ſight is that intellectuall and glorious ſight ſupernaturall of Gods eſſence face to face (as <hi>Paul</hi> nameth it) yea God himſelfe of ſo great Maieſty, might, beauty, goodneſſe, mercy and loue, <note place="margin">1.

And this is ſuch a ſight, in ſuch a manner, and after ſuch a meaſure (which notwithſtanding ſhall be infinite) as is or can bee poſſible, for the glorified Creatures to beholde the glorious Creator. And (as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſayeth) to bee made partakers of Gods diuine nature, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> farre beyond that ſight of <hi>Moyſes</hi> or <hi>Peters,</hi> when being clogged with mortality, they yet did ſee that was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to behold.</p>

               <p>In that Life ſhall bee no neede of meate, drinke, light, artificiall or naturall, Candle. Starres, Sunne, or Moone; For God ſhall bee all in all. By which ſight and ſupernaturall knowledge, it ſhall come to paſſe, That <note place="margin">Philip. 3,21</note>

                  <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſpeaking of this moſt glorious and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſight, ſayth thus: In a looking glaſſe wee may ſee three different things; the glaſſe, our ſelues, and what is neere vs: So by the glaſſe of Gods diuine clearenes, wee ſhall ſee him, our ſelues, Angels, and ſaints beſide vs; yea, we ſhall ſee God face to face, not as now through the glaſſe of his word; but we ſhal know him as we are known of his Maieſty. As a man ſtanding vpon the ſhore of the Sea ſeeth not the bredth or depth of it; ſo the Angels in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1365:152"/> Heauen, and the elect on earth may ſee God really, and yet not comprehend the depth of his greatnes, nor the height of his euerlaſting eſſence.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſight is that we ſhall likewiſe ſee the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from them both, and breathing vpon our ſaued ſoules, like a gentle ſoft ayre vpon a garden, and more ſweet then all the trees of Incenſe. Againe, the Apoſtle ſayeth, <hi>Now I know in part,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor: 13,12,</note> 
                  <hi>but then ſhall I know e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as I am knowne.</hi> The Apoſtle is bolde here to ſay, that all the knowledge wee haue here, is as the knowledge and ſtuttering of a young child, yea, that his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge too, was ſuch, although he were an Apoſtle, and a principall Apoſtle; and thereby hee inſinuateth that our knowledge here is as farre inferiour to the knowledge we ſhall haue there, as the knowledge of a childe that ſtut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth and ſtammereth, and yet cannot ſpeake plaine, is to the knowledge of the greateſt Clearke in the world.</p>
               <p>The very heathen thought this to bee one great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, that men, eſpecially wiſe men had by death, that their knowledge was perefected in the other world, and that none could poſſibly attaine to perfect wiſedome &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, vntill they came thither. How much more ſhould wee count this an ineſtimable glorie and benefite, that in the life to come wee ſhall haue the perfect knowledge of heauenly things, yea, and of all things in the Kingdom of Heauen; yea, we ſhall know God with a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo farre as Creatures can poſſibly comprehend the Creator.

And in him we ſhall know, not onely all our friendes (who dyed in the faith of Chriſt with vs) but alſo all the faithfull that euer were, or ſhall bee.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1365:153"/> ſentence of death perhaps (ſaith he) the Iudge is looked for, yea, but you ſhall iudge your Iudges your ſelues. But heere by the way wee are to vnderſtand, that the authoritie of iudgment doth not belong either to the Apoſtles or Saints; and that in their manner of iudgement they reſemble Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who at an Aſſiſe are in a manner Iudges, and yet giue no ſentence, but onely approue the ſentence that is giuen. The Iudges for the time haue the whole authoritie, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices on the Bench are but Aſſiſtants and witneſſes; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiue Iudgement is proper to our Sauiour Chriſt, <note place="margin">Acts 10.42.</note> who is the ſupreme Iudge himſelfe; <hi>For he it is,</hi>

Then if the Saints ſhall be aſſiſting in iudging wicked men and wicked ſpirits; it then followeth that they ſhall know the wicked from the good, the goats from the ſheep; and then much more ſhall they know their fellow-Iuſtices and Commiſſioners.

This place therefore (the holy Ghoſt framing himſelfe to our weake capacities) deſcribes by things moſt glorious, which no man can eſtimate, by things of moſt value, in the account and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation of men; and therefore he doth liken it to a great and holy Citie, named the New, holy and heauenly Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <note place="margin">Reu. 21.1.2.</note> where onely God, and his people who are ſaued and written in the Lambes booke, doe inhabite and dwell, all built of pure gold, like vnto cleare glaſſe or Criſtall, the walles of Iaſper ſtones, the foundations of the walles with twelue manner of pretious ſtones, hauing twelue gates, each built of one pearle, three gates toward each of the foure corners of the world, and at each gate an Angell, as ſo many porters to keepe it, that no vncleane thing may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſame.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:1365:161"/> hath not ſo much light as the ſtarres, which lighten it, and the ſtarres haue leſſe light then the Sun that lightneth them, from whence therefore it ſeemeth that in heauen alſo there ſhould rather be ſome want, then ſuch fulneſſe of heauenly ioyes and glorie? I anſwer, though in this condition of our heauenly life there may be degrees of glory, (<hi>In my fathers houſe,</hi> ſaith our Sauiour Chriſt, <note place="margin">Iohn 14.2.</note> 
                  <hi>are many manſions,</hi>) yet there ſhall be no want of glory: ſome may be like the skie, ſome the ſtarres of the skie, yet all ſhall ſhine: ſome veſſels may hold more, ſome leſſe, and yet all bee full: ſo one may haue more ioy then another, &amp; there are ſundry meaſures of more or leſſe glory in heauen. <hi>There is one glory of the Sunne,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15 41:</note> 
                  <hi>another of the Moone, and another glory of the ſtarres, for one ſtarre differeth from another in glory:</hi> but no meaſure ſhal lacke his fulneſſe of life and glory there, where ſhall be a meaſure of ioy heaped vp, ſhaken together, preſſed downe and running ouer. And (as <hi>Bernard</hi> very excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaketh) <note place="margin">Luke 6.38.</note> a meaſure without meaſure, where we ſhall be filled with ioy; yet being filled, wee ſhall ſtill deſire, leſt our fulneſſe procure a loathing, and in deſiring we ſhall alwaies be filled, leſt our deſire beget a grieuing; neither can God giue more, nor man receiue more then we ſhall there enioy; for there we ſhall be repleniſhed and ſatisfied with ſuch a fulneſſe of life, glory, and happineſſe, ſo as wee ſhall not bee able to deſire, or to haue any more; euen as veſſels caſt into the water, being ſo filled with water, that they can deſire or hold no more; and he that hath leaſt, ſhall haue enough. The reaſons hereof are theſe: Hell is contrarie to heauen; In hell there is a fulneſſe of torment, in heauen therefore there muſt be a fulneſſe and perfection of glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Secondly, earthly kingdomes, and the kings therof haue as great an abſoluteneſſe, as earth can affoord and giue them, and ſhal we thinke that heauen which can giue an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, wil giue an impefect crowne of righteouſneſſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Wil the kings of the earth dwel in baſe cottages, and not in royal Courts and Pallaces? and ſhall theſe kings of a far
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1365:162"/> better kingdome want ioy and glorie, wheras mortall kings haue ſo great glorie and power? Princes on the earth dwell in royall palaces, ſometimes of Cedar and Iuorie, but they whom the Sonne of God hath made kings and prieſts vnto God his Father, <note place="margin">Reu. 1.6.</note> (as it is in the booke of the Reuelation) ſhall raigne in a glorious citie and pallace, whoſe twelue gates are twelue pearles, <note place="margin">Reu. 21.18.</note> whoſe wall is of Iaſper, and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of gold, and whoſe ſtreetes ſhine as cleare glaſſe. So ſaid he that ſaw all this glorie but darkely, or as <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſaw the land of Canaan in a very ſhort mappe or card afarre off, as it doth appeare in the booke of Deuteronomie.<note place="margin">Deut. 34.1,2.3.4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee but the outward wall of this heauenly Court and City, and yet how glorious is it? and how deckt with ſtars as with ſparkling Diamonds? What would wee ſay, if wee could ſee into it, <note place="margin">Mat. 17.1.</note> and behold (though with <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> at a glance or bluſh ſuperficially) the goodly pauement of heauen within, whoſe floore is of gold, and wall about it garniſhed with precious ſtones? <note place="margin">Mat. 4.8.</note> And what is a kingdome here, where all the kingdomes of the world and the glorie of them were ſhewed in the twinkling of an eye, <note place="margin">Luke 4 5.</note> as it is in the Goſpel? if there were not hope of a better kingdome; where all ſhall be kings, and reigne with Chriſt eternallly. And they which here haue reigned as kings vpon the earth, ſhall loſe nothing, but gaine immeaſurably by the change: yea kings and queenes which haue beene nurſing fathers and nurſing mothers to the Church of God (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) when they come thither, <note place="margin">Iſay 49.23.</note> ſhall caſt away their Crownes as <hi>Elias,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.

                  <hi>bonum eſt eſſe hic,</hi> It is good to be here in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but for the earth, they ſhall bee as loth to looke backe vnto it, as <hi>Moyſes</hi> to goe backe into the land of Egypt. For their pallaces ſhall then ſeeme priſons, their golden chaines
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:1365:162"/> golden fetters, their crownes croſſes, and all their earthly honors but burdens, and vexations. But when they ſhall looke vpon the face of God, they ſhall ſay to him with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph as it is in the Pſalme, <hi>With thee is the well of life,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 16.11.</note> 
                  <hi>in thy preſence is the fulneſſe of ioy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for euermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if <hi>Adams</hi> paradiſe and garden was ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pleaſant, how pleaſant and glorious is Gods owne ſeat of his owne reſidence? He ſpake it with a wondring tongue, whoſe heart could not comprehend ſo infinite an excellencie, in ſaying (as we haue heard before) <hi>How glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things are ſpoken of thee O thou city of God!</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 87.3.</note> For though in the letter, this worthy Prophet ſpake of that earthly heauen, which he confeſſed to be in the material tabernacle, becauſe of Gods preſence, and the godly exerciſes of Gods people performed there, yet his meaning was vnder the cloud of the phraſe to direct Gods children to a higher tabernacle and houſe of greater glory then that which was earthly, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the doome of time.</p>
               <p>Againe ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3,7,8,9,10,11.</note> 
                  <hi>If the miniſtration of death written and ingrauen in the ſtones was glorious, ſo that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly behold the face of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to bee done away, how ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit bee rather glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious? For if the miniſtration of condemnation be glorious, much more doth the miniſtration of righteouſneſſe exceed in glorie. For euen that which was made glorious, had no glory in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, by reaſon of the glorie that excelleth. For if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</hi> And if the preaching of the Goſpel whereby God giueth his quickening ſpirit, working the life of grace in his elect, be glorious then much more ſhall the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpel be made partakers of farre greater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee doe reade in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.23.</note> that when <hi>Dauid</hi> was perſwaded by <hi>Saul,</hi> by the meanes of his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:1365:163"/> ſeruant to become the Kings ſonne in law, it is there ſaid by <hi>Dauid, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be the Kings ſonne in law, ſeeing that I am a poore man, and lightly eſteemed?</hi> Then if it be accounted a great honor and glory to be a ſonne and childe to an earthly King, much more honorable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is to be the ſonne and childe of the King of heauen. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>what manner of loue the Father hath beſtowed vpon vs,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that wee ſhould bee called the ſonnes of God?</hi> Which glorie all the tongues of men and Angels (as wee haue heard before) can in no wiſe expreſſe, as witneſſeth the bleſſed and glorious Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, who was in it, <note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p>Now if the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> (as we heard before) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſeruants of King <hi>Salomon</hi> happie, <note place="margin">1.

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 18.10.</note> euen the God of glory himſelfe. In which reſpect Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on his death bed ſaid, We are happie in this, that we ſerue ſo good a Maſter, <hi>Yea happie is the people</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that is in ſuch a caſe,</hi>

                  <hi>yea happie is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> Yea bleſſed and happie are all thoſe, which ſo liue in this world, that departing hence they may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to come into ſo glorious a place and preſence.

               <p>In the meane time, till thou come into this glorious place and preſence, aske of God by heartie and faithfull prayer, to giue thee grace entirely and from the bottome of thy heart, both to vnderſtand and deſire the ioyes and glory thereof, and ſo to be affected and rauiſhed with the delight thereof, that euer and euery where thou mayeſt be ſtirred vp to ſerue ſo good a Maſter in pureneſſe and newneſſe of life, that thou mayeſt be made partaker thereof; <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.24.</note> and pray with the Prophet that the Lord would guide thee with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and afterwards receiue thee into his glory. <note place="margin">Iohn 16.24.</note>
