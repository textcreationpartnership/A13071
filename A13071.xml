         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>THE FIRST DIVISION, OF THE certaintie of Death.</head>
               <p>THis fir≈øt Diui≈øion containing the certaintie of death, is properly ≈øubdiuided into three parts: The fir≈øt is into the death (which is naturall) of the bodie: the ≈øecond is the ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall death of the ≈øoule in ≈øinne: and the third is the eternall death of both body and ≈øoule in hell.</p>
               <p>To the≈øe three deaths are oppo≈øed three liues, the life of Nature, of Grace, and of Glorie.</p>
               <p>Naturall or bodily death, which is called the fir≈øt, (becau≈øe in re≈øpect of time, it goeth before the third in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding) is a di≈ø≈øolution or ≈øeparation of the ≈øoule from the bodie for a time, namely vntill the re≈øurrection.</p>
               <p>The ≈øpirituall death which is termed the ≈øecond, is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ≈øeparation of the ≈øoule principally, but con≈øequently of body and ≈øoule from God; of which, Sinne is the mother, the Diuell is the father, and Damnation is the daughter; and this is when men die not to ≈øinne, but in ≈øinne.</p>
               <p>Eternall death is the hire and wages of the ≈øecond, and this euer followes the reprobate after the fir≈øt.</p>
               <p>Both the≈øe latter are a ≈øeparation of the whole man, bodie and ≈øoule from the fellow≈øhip of God: The fir≈øt is an entrance to death, the ≈øecond and third are the accompli≈øhment of it. The fir≈øt is temporarie, the ≈øecond and third are ≈øpirituall and eternall. The fir≈øt is of the body onely, the ≈øecond and third are of both bodie and ≈øoule.

               <p>Moreouer and be≈øides all the≈øe things, there is yet an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall warre, which man hath within his owne bowels continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: For what man is he, which feeleth not the ≈øtriuings, ≈øtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and contentions of his owne affection, will, ≈øen≈øe, and rea≈øon? In ≈øo much that man him≈øelfe doth afflict him≈øelfe, and vnder≈øtandeth it not. Yea he is a greater enemy to him≈øelfe, then any other can bee. For who doth greater harme to thee then thou do≈øt to thy ≈øelfe? Who more then thy ≈øelfe letteth thee, and turneth thee away from thy felicitie? Who then ≈øeeth not that man is ≈øet in the very Center of the Spheres, that mi≈øeries may fall vpon him from euery part; and as the white in a butte, <note place="margin">Lam. 3.12.</note> that the arrowes and darts of all mi≈øeries and kinds
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1365:10"/> of death may bee directed vnto him? Walke≈øt thou in the ≈øtreets? the tiles aboue thy head threaten thy downefall: In the fields, the ayre is ready to conuey infection into thy lungs, the earth grones vnder thee, as loath to beare ≈øo vnprofitable a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. At la≈øt comes death with his napkin on his ≈øleeue, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.22.23.</note> and his trencher-knife in his hand, and with his voider takes all away.</p>
               <p>But let vs ≈øee what followeth. <hi>Iob</hi> telleth thee, <hi>that man ≈øhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth as a flower, and is cut downe,</hi> whereby he teacheth that mans life is fraile and tran≈øitorie. A flower verily is a comely and a beautifull thing; and yet for all that it is nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there is nothing found more fading and vani≈øhing. Euen ≈øo man, during the time of his fading and flouri≈øhing youth, ≈øeemeth to be of a wonderfull comeline≈ø≈øe; but this beauty is of ≈ømall price, becau≈øe it is more britle then the gra≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing that man carrieth alwayes the cau≈øe of his owne death in his vaines and bowels. For mans fading away is ≈øuch, and ≈øo ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den oftentimes, that there can be no rea≈øon giuen of his death; for many haue gone to bedde well in the euening that in the morning are found dead in their beds; and many that haue bin well at their vpri≈øing, haue beene dead before the euening; and many very ≈øodainly haue dropped downe in the ≈øtreetes and high-wayes, as they haue walked about their affaires: And this is no wonder, if we con≈øider well the ≈øub≈øtance of mans body, which being a building compact of ≈øl mie clay, is ea≈øily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne with a ≈ømall thing.</p>
               <p>And how commeth it to pa≈ø≈øe (I pray you) that clockes are ≈øo ea≈øily ≈øtopped from their cour≈øe? Is it not becau≈øe they are made with ≈øo many wheeles, that if one be ≈øtayed, all the re≈øt be letted. If this befall clockes that haue wheeles of Iron and ≈øteele, how much more ea≈øily may it come to pa≈ø≈øe in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane clocke of mans body, the wheeles and engines whereof are not of Iron, neither <hi>part of yron, and part of clay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 2.33.</note> like the feete of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Image, but all of clay. And <hi>behold as the clay is in the Potters hand, ≈øo are yee in mine hand,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 18.6.</note> 
                  <hi>O hou≈øe of I≈ørael,</hi> ≈øaith the Lord by his Prophet.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1365:11"/>
               <p>Therefore let vs not wonder at the frailtie of mans body, but at the fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe of mans minde, who vpon ≈øo fraile a foundation is wont to erect and build ≈øuch loftie towers.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is another mi≈øery which is ≈øignified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the compari≈øon of flower, as namely the deceitfulnes of mans life; the which indeed is the greate≈øt mi≈øerie. For as fained vertue is double iniquitie, ≈øo counterfeit happine≈ø≈øe is a two-fold mi≈øerie and calamitie. If this pre≈øent life would ≈øhew it ≈øelfe to be ≈øuch as it is indeed, the mi≈øery thereof ≈øhould not greatly hurt vs; but as it is, it doth greatly damnifie vs, becau≈øe it is fal≈øe and deceitfull, and being foule, it maketh a very faire and glorious ≈øhew; being euer mutable, it will ≈øeeme to bee ≈øtable and con≈øtant, being mo≈øt ≈øhort, it beareth vs in hand that it is continuall; that ≈øo men (being deceiued) may beleeue that they ≈øhall haue time to fulfill all their lu≈øts, and yet time and ≈øpace enough to repent. Holy <hi>Iob</hi> concludeth this ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thus, <hi>He vani≈øheth al≈øo as a ≈øhadow, and neuer continueth at one ≈øtay.</hi> To make this more plaine, behold and con≈øider the ≈øeuerall ages of man, and thou ≈øhalt euidently perceiue the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerable alterations of humane life. Childhood is weake, as well in minde as in body; flouri≈øhing youth is weake in mind, but ≈øtrong in bodie; ripe and manly age ≈øtrong both in mind and body, old age ≈øtrong in mind, and weak in body; crooked old doting age, is in this twice a childe, weake both in minde and bodie: therefore <hi>man flyeth as a ≈øhadow, and neuer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at one ≈øtay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be≈øides this, he is now wi≈øe, now fooli≈øh, now merry, now ≈øad, now in health, anon ≈øicke, now ≈øtrong, anon weake, now rich, anon poore, now he loueth anon he hateth, now he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, by and by hee feareth, one while hee laugheth, another while he weepeth, now he will, anon hee will not. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Moone, or any other thing that is changeable, ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ≈øo many changes to vs, as doe the daily and mo≈øt ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alterations of men. And yet for all this they liue as men in a frenzie, which know not their owne mi≈øeries. Yet if it were po≈ø≈øible, they would make the place of their exile and bani≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1365:11"/> their countrie and inheritance. But in vaine they de≈øire this, for death commeth ere they are aware, ≈øhutting vp and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhing the life it ≈øelfe.</p>
               <p>So the mi≈øeries incident to the ≈øeueral ages of man, are from the fir≈øt comming vp vpon the ≈øtage of this world, to the la≈øt act of going downe, <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 1.14.</note> in al parts of the life full of <hi>vanitie and vexation of ≈øpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the fir≈øt entrance is our infancie, when wee are in our nur≈øes armes: and doth not that begin with teares and feares? And is not all that time vnhappie? ≈øauing that we want rea≈øon, that is, the v≈øe thereof to apprehend that happine≈ø≈øe. When we come out of our nur≈øes armes, to goe in their hands, or to goe by our ≈øelues, in our next age doe we not weepe long vnder the rod, falling into the ≈øubiection of a teacher? Among≈øt the ancient Romanes this was their manner and cu≈øtome for their youth, They let their children ≈øuck vntill they were two yeers old, till they were foure yeeres old, they let them play, till ≈øixe they taught them to reade, till eight to write, till ten they learne the Grammer. When a boy was once ten yeeres old, he was ≈øet ≈øtraight way to ≈øome good trade and occupation, or el≈øe ≈øent to the warres, which was a thing the Romanes gloried in mo≈øt, to bee good ≈øouldiers. In all which ages they ≈øu≈øtained great mi≈øeries, being all this time vnder Tutors and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
               <p>When we come out of the pri≈øon of boyes and girles, and are ≈øet at ≈øome more libertie in a yong mans life, are wee not to≈ø≈øed, as vpon a ≈øea of vnquietne≈ø≈øe, ≈øailing betweene rea≈øon and pa≈ø≈øion, as between two contrary waters and cro≈ø≈øe winds. Then commeth perfect age or mans age, and what haue wee heere but bla≈øtes and ≈øtormes of greater vnre≈øt then in any age before? From one trauaile we pa≈ø≈øe to another, neuer ending but changing our mi≈øeries. And when we come to old age, and haue liued ≈øo long that we are come to dotage: is there any thing in the≈øe ages exempt from mi≈øerie and trauaile, that is vnder the Sunne?</p>
               <p>Surely our infirmities do then come vpon vs in multitudes,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1365:12"/> yea ≈øo loade vs with their waight and number, that they make vs to bowe and goe double vnder them vnto the earth. And can there be any comfort in the≈øe di≈øea≈øes (as I may call them) and dayes of euill, wherein doe meete and flocke together ≈øo many vultures of life, the weakene≈ø≈øe of infancie, the ≈øeruitude of childehood, the ≈øickne≈ø≈øe of youth, the cares of mans age? All which come againe, and come all together, as many ≈øtormes, vpon one poore old ruinous hou≈øe, that is ≈øore ≈øhaken alreadie, by death violently to ouerthrow it for euer. Heere the exce≈ø≈øe and ryot of youth is exerci≈øed with gouts, pal≈øies, and ≈øundrie fearefull aches; the watching and cares of manhood are puni≈øhed with lo≈ø≈øe of ≈øight, of hearing, and of ≈øence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the ≈øence of paine.</p>
               <p>There is no part of man, which death in that age of yeares, doth not take, in hope to be a≈ø≈øured of him, as of a bad pay-ma≈øter which greatly feareth, and would gladly put off his dayes of payment. And therefore it bringeth him low in all parts, that he may haue power in none to auoid his Creditor, and end ≈øo neere.</p>
               <p>And touching the mi≈øeries incident to the ≈øeuerall ages of man, the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> crieth out, <hi>How is it that I came out of the wombe to ≈øee labour and ≈øorrow,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 20.18.</note> 
                  <hi>that my dayes ≈øhould be con≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ≈øhame?</hi> How much more cau≈øe haue we mi≈øerable creatures, to crie out of our calamities and mi≈øeries, who were conceiued and borne in ≈øinne, ≈øeeing the Prophet complained ≈øo much, <note place="margin">51.5. Ier. 1.5.</note> being ≈øanctified in his mothers wombe.</p>
               <p>O vaine, mi≈øerable, and vnhappie men, before we ≈øinne, we are ≈øtraite fa≈øtened to ≈øinne, and before we can offend, wee are fa≈øt bound with offence.</p>
               <p>Con≈øider, O man, from whence thou came≈øt, blu≈øh whither thou goe≈øt, and feare where thou liue≈øt. We are begotten in vncleanne≈ø≈øe, brought foorth with paines and throwes, and nouri≈øhed in darkne≈ø≈øe. Wee begin our tragedie with naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe and weeping, we continue with paine and vexation, and take our farewell with ≈øorrow and mi≈øerie. Our beginning is lamentable, our continuance wretched, and our departure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1365:12"/> grieuous. The whole life of man is be≈øet and incountred with three capitall enemies, Paine, Care, and Sorrow: Paine pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, Care con≈øumeth vs, and Sorrow endeth vs. There is no age of man free from affliction, calamitie and mi≈øerie. And to begin againe with the mi≈øeries of infancie; behold in his birth, intollerable is his mothers paine, and infinite are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants calamities, who commeth into the world crying and weeping, poore and naked, weake and mi≈øerable, without ≈øpeech, without knowledge or ≈øtrength, no ≈øooner is the babe borne, but ≈øtraight is hee bound hand and foote, and ca≈øt into a cradle, as into a pri≈øon, prefiguring the ≈øeruitude hee is to ≈øuffer.</p>
               <p>In his childhood he beginneth to warre with the lacke of rea≈øon, and to fight again≈øt his owne folly, not knowing what hee is, where hee is, whence nor for what hee came into the world.</p>
               <p>Now mu≈øt he be kept vnder the feare of the rod, and learne ≈øome Liberall Science, or ≈øome Mechanicall Arte or Trade, whereby to maintaine his fraile life hereafter, if hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it.</p>
               <p>Then commeth youth, ra≈øh, head-≈øtrong, voluptuous, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, fooli≈øh, prodigall, pa≈ø≈øionate. In this age he commeth into great dangers, fighting again≈øt the de≈øires of the fle≈øh, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt fond affections, and vaine imaginations, which cau≈øe the minde to wauer, and bee incon≈øtant, and to bee carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with ≈øundrie phanta≈øies. In this age hee becommeth a drunkard, a game≈øter, a quarreller, a loo≈øe liuer, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be ca≈øt into pri≈øon, to bee hanged, and to lo≈øe all that hee hath, and to be a great griefe vnto his parents, <note place="margin">Gen. 42.38.</note> in cau≈øing them thereby to end their dayes in ≈øorrow; in the ≈øence and feeling whereof, the Prophet crieth vnto God, ≈øaying, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 25.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not the ≈øinnes of my youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterward, as he hath to encounter with manhood, to which age is incident, the charge of wife &amp; children, the maintenance of family and care of po≈øterity. <hi>He that is maried</hi> (≈øaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle) <hi>careth for the things that are of the world,</hi>

               <p>Then la≈øtly commeth old age ≈øtealing on vnperceiued, <hi>yea gray haires</hi> (≈øaith the Prophet) <hi>are heere and there vpon him,</hi>

Kinde knoweth not riches, that bringeth forth all men poore, for we be not got with rich cloathes, and borne with gold, ne with ≈øiluer: naked he bringeth them into the world, needy of meat, and drinke, and cloathing, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the earth taketh vs, as ≈øhe naked brought vs hither. She cannot clo≈øe with vs our po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion in ≈øepulcher, for kinde maketh no difference, betweene poore and rich in comming hither, ne in going hence. All in one manner he bringeth forth, and in one manner he clo≈øeth in graue.</p>
               <p>Who ≈øo will make difference between poore and rich, abide till they haue a little while lyen in graue, then open &amp; looke among dead bones, <note place="margin">Lam. 4.5.</note> who was rich, and who was poore, but if it be thus that more cloathes rot with the rich then with the poore, and that doth harme to them that are then liuing, not profiting them that be dead. And it may be that the wormes ≈øhall feede more ≈øweetely on the rich, <note place="margin">Iob. 24.20.</note> then on the poore. But thou wilt ≈øay (≈øaith Saint <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>) I am not ≈øuch a one as he is, God forbid I ≈øhould be ≈øo, he is ba≈øe and beggerly, I am high, honorable and rich; tell me not (≈øaith Saint <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi>) The ods of your apparell, or other externall things, but marke ye the qualitie of nature, remember the day of your birth, and the day of your death. There is no difference in the one or the other, both weake, both mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for all of all ≈øorts and conditions are made of one mold, and one matter, of clay and earth, who≈øe foundation is in the

For as great men haue no priuiledge from error, nor protection from reproofe, for their faults blameable, ≈øo haue they no priuiledge from Death. For all men haue one entrance into the world, a like danger in life, the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øity of death, re≈øpect cannot change nature, nor circum≈øtance alter ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance: a great man is a man, a man hath a body and a ≈øoule, both haue their di≈øea≈øes, which greatne≈ø≈øe can neuer dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh, but oftentimes augments. And therefore in a bodily infirmitie of ≈øome noble per≈øonages, the Phi≈øition takes them in hand, not as noble men, but as men.

               <head>THE SECOND DIVISION, ON THE MEDITATION OF DEATH.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hen if Death be thus certaine, in the next place the law of rea≈øon adui≈øeth vs to thinke of the worlds vanitie to contemne it, of death to expect it, of iudgement to auoid it, of hell to e≈øcape it, and of heauen to de≈øire it. And thinke it not needle≈ø≈øe or ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to bee exhorted to this Meditation; that the ignorant may learne, the carele≈ø≈øe con≈øider, and the forgetfull remember that they all mu≈øt die. For, as Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, nothing ≈øo recalleth a man from ≈øinne, as the frequent remembrance of death. For the error of all men, for the mo≈øt part, taketh his originall from hence, that they forget the end of their life, which they ought alwayes to haue before their eyes. And of the want of this commeth pride, ambition, vaine-glory, too much carefulne≈ø≈øe of the body, too much car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and caring after the things of this life. Hence al≈øo it commeth that we build Towers vpon the ≈øand. For if wee did con≈øider what we ≈øhall be after a few dayes, our manner of liuing would perhaps bee more humble, temperate and godly,: for who would haue a high looke, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 131.1.</note> and a proud ≈øto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, if hee did with the eyes of his minde behold what
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1365:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> manner of one he ≈øhortly after ≈øhall be in his graue? who would then wor≈øhip his belly for a god, <note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> when he waigheth with him≈øelfe that the ≈øame mu≈øt in ≈øhort time be wormes meate? who would be ≈øo in loue with money, that he would runne like a mad-man by ≈øea and land (as it were through fire and water) if he vnder≈øtood that he mu≈øt leaue all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him?</p>
               <p>If this were well thought vpon, our errors would ≈øoone be corrected, and our liues bettered. Wi≈øh therefore rather for a good, then a long life. It is a thing doubtle≈ø≈øe, worthy of euery mans be≈øt thoughts and intentions. For ≈øeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man mu≈øt die, and hath a cour≈øe to fini≈øh, which being fini≈øhed, hee mu≈øt away. It is ≈øpeciall wi≈ødome to learne to know the length of his dayes, as it were the length of his lea≈øe: for as he hath v≈øed him≈øelfe in his farme, he ≈øhall enter at the expiration of his time vpon a better or a wor≈øe.</p>

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> for his learning a Prophet, for his acceptation, <hi>a man after Gods owne heart,</hi> for his authority a King, was then very ≈øtudious in this knowledge, when after fa≈øting and watching, he be≈øought God to be in≈øtructed in it. <hi>Lord let me know my end,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P≈øal. 39.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and the mea≈øure of my dayes, what it is, let me know how long I haue to liue.</hi>

               <p>What thinke you it will profit a man, if by his skill in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetike, hee be able to deale with euery number, and to diuide the lea≈øt fractions, and neuer to thinke on the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of his daies with the men of God, and yet his dayes are few and euill?</p>
               <p>What will it profit him, if by Geometrie hee bee able to take the longitude of mo≈øt ≈øpatious pro≈øpects, and not be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1365:35"/> able to mea≈øure that which the Prophet hath mea≈øured with his ≈øpanne?<note place="margin">P≈øal. 39.51.</note>
               </p>
               <p>What will it auaile him, if with the a≈øtronomer he be able to ob≈øerue and know the motions of the heauens, and yet haue his heart ≈øo buried in the earth, that hee cannot thinke of that which pa≈ø≈øeth away as ≈øwiftly as any motion of them all?</p>
               <p>What profiteth it (I ≈øay) If he be able, with the Philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, to ≈øearch out the cau≈øes of many effects, and to know the cau≈øes of many changes, as of the ebbing and flowing of the ≈øeas the increa≈øing and wayning of the Moone, and the like, and be not able to know his owne changes, and the cau≈øes of them? Doubtle≈ø≈øe all this wil profit them nothing, all this knowledge will be to little purpo≈øe in the end. And vnle≈ø≈øe they think vpon death, they cannot apply and fa≈øhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them≈øelues to a godly life. Yea we finde daily by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the forgetfulne≈ø≈øe of death maketh vs applie our hearts to all kinde of folly and vanity.</p>
               <p>The holy men in old time were wont to keepe ≈øuch an account of their dayes, and ≈øo to think on death, that aboue all things they might apply their hearts vnto wi≈ødome. So mindfull of the≈øe things was Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> who ≈øaith of him≈øelfe, that whether he did eate or drinke, or what≈øoeuer el≈øe he did, he thought alwaies this ≈øound of the la≈øt trumpet did euer ring in his eares. <hi>Ari≈øe yee dead, and come to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Which when I con≈øider (≈øaith he) it makes me ≈øhake and quake and not dare to commit ≈øinne, which otherwi≈øe I ≈øhould haue committed.</p>
               <p>Likewi≈øe that ancient and reuerend father <hi>Innocentius</hi> the fourth, was ≈øo carefull to auoid the vengeance to come that to ≈øtirre vp all the powers and faculties of his minde, with due con≈øideration of the vanitie of this world, the vilene≈ø≈øe of his nature, the ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of his time, the cau≈øes of ≈øinne, and the puni≈øhment for the ≈øame, he ≈øtill imagined to heare a damned ≈øoule an≈øwere his demand, as followeth, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of an interlocution or dialogue.

                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> that mighty Monarch and Emperor of the Per≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1365:36"/> (beholding from a high place) the hugene≈ø≈øe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in ≈øtrength inuincible, in quality diuers, in number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, in who≈øe courage and might he had fully repo≈øed the ≈øtrength of his Kingdome, the ≈øafegard of his per≈øon, and glory of his Empire, could not refraine his eyes from teares, con≈øidering that of all this maruelous multitude which hee ≈øaw, that after one hundred yeares, there ≈øhould not a man be left. And ≈øhall we that are Chri≈øtians, (at lea≈øt wi≈øe by name) viewing from the highe≈øt pinnacle of our conceit, our ≈øelues, our glory, magnificence and renowne, our wealth, our ≈øtrength, our freinds, our health, and all our brauery, wherein we repo≈øe all our felicity and happine≈ø≈øe, be nothing moued with the due con≈øideration of our Death, and with the pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing away of the world, and the concupi≈øcence thereof? Therefore ≈øaith <hi>Martial</hi> an antient Bi≈øhop, what haue we to doe with the delight of the world, that it ≈øhould hinder vs from the meditation on Death? You may call it as you will, either plea≈øure, pa≈øtime, gladne≈ø≈øe, mirth, ioy: but in Gods dictionary it hath no ≈øuch name, in the holy ≈øcripture it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe called. It is called <hi>Adams</hi> goodlie apple, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.17. Gen. 25.30. 1 Sam. 14 43. Ioh. 13.27. Reu. 1. Luk. 15.16.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten, depriued him of paradi≈øe. <hi>E≈øaus</hi> redde broath, which being ≈øupt vp bereaued him of his birthright. <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> ≈øweete honycombe, which being but ta≈øted, was like to co≈øt him his life. Thus is all the delight in the world called in Gods dictionarie. It is called <hi>Adams</hi> apple, <hi>E≈øaus</hi> broath, <hi>Ionathans</hi> hony-combe. So that all this delight is no delight, or ≈øuppo≈øe it were, yet certainely it ≈øhall not giue thee the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires of thy heart.</p>
               <p>As any ≈øolide body, though it haue neuer ≈øo faire a colour, as crim≈øon, or cornation, or purple, or ≈øcarlet, or violet, or ≈øuch like, yet alwaies the ≈øhadow of it is black, ≈øo any earthly thing, though it haue neuer ≈øo faire a ≈øhew yet alwaies the ≈øhadow of it is blacke, and the delight thou take≈øt in it ≈øhall prooue to be grieuous in the end when thou mu≈øt leaue all. Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it a ≈øweete bitter thing; ≈øo likewi≈øe if we meditate on Death, it will make vs to call all the≈øe

And it would make vs ≈øay with the Apo≈øtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> God forbid that I ≈øhould delight in any thing but in the cro≈ø≈øe and death of Chri≈øt by which the world is crucified vnto me, and I vnto the world.</p>
               <p>But of all arithmeticall rules, this is the harde≈øt, to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our daies. Men can number their heards and droues of Oxen and ≈øheepe, they can account the reuenues of their lands and farmes, they can with a little paines number their coyne and gaines, &amp; yet they are per≈øwaded that their daies are infinit and innumerable, and therefore they neuer begin to number, nor thinke on them for the which they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer find any lea≈øure. Who ≈øaith not vpon the view of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ≈øurely yonder man looketh by his countenance as if he would not liue long, yonder woman is old, her daies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be many? Thus we can number the dayes and yeares of others, and vtterly forget our owne. But the true wi≈ødome of mortall men is to number their owne daies, and like skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Geometricians to mea≈øure all their actions, all their ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, all their cares and indeauours, all their thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires, and all their coun≈øells by their departure out of this life (as the end whereunto they are re≈øerued) as it were by a certaine rule, and thereunto to direct all things, and ≈øo to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the cour≈øe of our life which God hath giuen vs, that at la≈øt we may come to the hauen of eternall re≈øt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>What if we had dyed in the dayes of ignorance, like <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that hanged him≈øelfe before he could ≈øee the pa≈ø≈øion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection, or a≈øcen≈øion of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt? We ≈øhould then haue numbred our daies and our ≈øinnes too. But ala≈ø≈øe how many dayes haue we ≈øpent, and yet neuer thought why one day was giuen vs? But as the old yeare went, and an other came, ≈øo we thought that a new would follow that, and ≈øo we thinke that another will follow this, and God knoweth how ≈øoone wee ≈øhall be deceiued. For ≈øo thought many of them before, who are now in their graues.</p>
               <p>Dearely beloued, this is not to number our dayes, but to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1365:37"/> prouoke God to ≈øhorten our dayes. I that write, you that read, and all that heare this, which of vs hath not liued twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeeres, yea ≈øome forty, fiftie, or more, and yet wee haue neuer ≈øeriou≈øly thought on Death, nor applyed our hearts aright vnto wi≈ødome. O if we had learned but euery yeere one vertue, ≈øince wee were borne, we might by this time haue bene like Saints among≈øt men, whereas if God at this pre≈øent time ≈øhould call vs to iudgment, it would appeare that we had applyed our hearts, mindes, memories, hands, feete, tongues, and all our whole bodies to all kinde of ≈øinne and wickedne≈ø≈øe, but not applyed our ≈øelues at all to wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, godline≈ø≈øe, vertue, and true piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> was wont to walke among≈øt the graues, that he might become a right Philo≈øopher; for true philo≈øophie (≈øaith <hi>Plato</hi>) is the meditation on death; and thou which art in≈øtructed in the true Chri≈øtian Philo≈øophie, how can≈øt thou behold the bones of the dead, but thou mu≈øt needs fall into this patheticall meditation with thy ≈øelfe. Behold the≈øe legges that haue made ≈øo many iourneyes, this head which is the receptacle of wi≈ødome, &amp; remembreth ≈øo many things, mu≈øt ≈øhortly be as this bare skull and dry bones are. I will therefore betimes bid worldly vanities <hi>adieu,</hi> betake my ≈øelfe to repentance, and newne≈ø≈øe of life, and ≈øpend the re≈øt of my dayes in the ≈øeruice of my God, and continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on my ende.</p>
               <p>As the la≈øt day of our life leaueth vs, ≈øo ≈øhall that la≈øt day the day of Chri≈øts comming finde vs. How good were it therefore before we run into de≈øperate arrerages, to ca≈øt vp our bils of accompt, and the rather becau≈øe we ≈øhall be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of our office we know not how ≈øoone. <note place="margin">Luke 16.2.</note> Some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors among≈øt the heathen (as bookes ≈øay) were wont to be crowned ouer the graues, and ≈øepulchers of dead men, to teach them by the certaine but vnknowne end of their ≈øhort life, to v≈øe their great roomes, as men that mu≈øt one day be as they are, who≈øe graues they tread vpon.</p>
               <p>The old Saints, who liued in a continuall meditation of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1365:38"/> their ≈øhort and vncertaine time, were wont alwayes like wi≈øe merchants to think of their returne homeward; and therfore tooke vp their trea≈øure by bils of payment, not where they were, but where they would be, and meant to make their long aboade, that is meant to be for euer.

               <p>Had it not beene for ≈øinne, Death had neuer entred into the world, and were it not for Death, ≈øinne would neuer goe out of the world. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> ≈øaith, God made not death, but we our ≈øelues, by our wicked mindes, of our owne accord, we haue drawne it on our ≈øelues, which God did not at all forbid, le≈øt it ≈øhould keepe in vs an immortall di≈øea≈øe.

               <p>The ancient Egyptians well knew the force of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, who in the midde≈øt of their mirth at their ≈øolemne Fea≈øts, were wont to haue the image of Death brought in and laid before them, with the≈øe words; <hi>Hoc intuens epulare:</hi> beholding this Image, eate and drinke, but within the

                  <hi>Diony≈øius</hi> the tyrant cau≈øed his notable flatterer <hi>Damocles</hi> (who affirmed the life of a King to be mo≈øt happie) to be ≈øet in his regall Throne in ≈øtately robes and all Princely cheere, and dainty fare before him, and a naked ≈øword tyed but with a hor≈øe-haire to hang ouer his head, menacing him Death. Could this Para≈øite (thinke you) take any delight in this princely fare and pompe? No verily, but as if he had ≈øat among≈øt the greate≈øt hagges of hell, he dur≈øt not once touch the dainty di≈øhes before him; and ≈øhall not the meditation on Death either pre≈øent or hard at hand, and the ≈øword of the wrathfull Iudge drawne and hanging ouer thine head re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine thee from immoderate and ≈øuperfluous eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>It is recorded al≈øo of a certaine King who≈øe minde was ≈øo fixed in the deepe meditation on Death, that thereby hee became more ≈øober and mode≈øt in all his actions, who being incited by his Ie≈øter or Para≈øite to be merry, banquet and carow≈øe; hee commanded his Para≈øite to be ≈øet on a ≈øeate made with rotten wood, fire to be put vnder, and a ≈øword to hang ouer his head, and al≈øo princely di≈øhes to be ≈øet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and willed him to eate, drinke and be merry, but this ≈øtomacke would not ≈øerue him ≈øo much as to ta≈øt one of thefe dainty di≈øhes; and wilt thou O drunkard or glutton ≈øinne in exce≈ø≈øe, and make thy belly thy God, who ≈øitte≈øt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rotten body, with the fire of naturall heat continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deuouring within it, which the fire of the elementarie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1365:44"/> qualities on euery ≈øide di≈øturbeth, hauing the <hi>Etna</hi> of hell beneath, and the ≈øword of Gods wrath aboue.</p>
               <p>Euen thus ≈øtandeth our ca≈øe; a certaine diuine writer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth this compari≈øon. A poore traueller pur≈øued by an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne, by chance in his flight, ≈ølippes or falles into the ≈øide of a deepe pit or dungeon, which is full of cruell ≈øerpents, and in his fall catcheth hold by one ≈ømall twig of the arme of a tree. As hee thus hangeth, looking downeward, hee ≈øeeth two wormes gnawing at the roote of the tree, and looking vpward he ≈øees an hiue of ≈øweete hony, which makes him to climbe vp vnto it, and to ≈øit and feede vpon it. While he thus feedeth him≈øelfe, and becommeth ≈øecure and carele≈ø≈øe of what may come, the Vnicorne being hunger-bitten, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and bru≈øing on other boughes, is each moment ready to crop of the twigge whereon this wretched man ≈øitteth. Now in what wofull plight is this di≈øtre≈ø≈øed creature? Then after this the two wormes gnawe in ≈øunder the roote of the tree, which falling downe, both man and tree fall into the bottom of that deepe pit. This hungry Vnicorne is ≈øwift death, the poore traueller that flyeth is euery ≈øonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the pit ouer which he hangeth is hell, the arme of the tree and ≈ølender twigge is his fraile and ≈øhort life, tho≈øe two wormes are the wormes of con≈øcience, which day and night without intermi≈ø≈øion con≈øume the ≈øame, the hiue of hony is the plea≈øures of this world, to which while men wholly deuote them≈øelues (not remembring their la≈øt end) the roote of the tree, that is the temporall life is ≈øpent, and they fall without redemption into the pit and gulfe of hell. If thou thus ≈øeriou≈øly ponder this thy vn≈øtable e≈øtate, I ≈øuppo≈øe thou wilt take little plea≈øure in ryot and di≈ø≈øolute liuing.</p>
               <p>Giue tho≈øe that are condemned to dy, <hi>Nectar,</hi> giue them <hi>Ambro≈øia,</hi> giue them <hi>Manna,</hi> the bread of Angells, and will they ta≈øt it? No, they can neither eat, drinke, laugh or ≈øleepe, and wilt thou that art already condemned and guiltie of death (perchance) this very moment to be inflicted vpon
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1365:44"/> thee, ≈øecurely addict thy ≈øelfe to drunkenne≈ø≈øe, gluttonie, exce≈ø≈øe, and to al manner of riotous and intemperate liuing? Remember rather the rich glutton in the Go≈øpell, <note place="margin">Luke 16.23.</note> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had pampered his body all the dayes of his life, in the end Death made him a fat di≈øh for the wormes, his fle≈øh and bones were con≈øumed into du≈øt, but (which was mo≈øt terrible) his ≈øoule was ca≈øt into hell, the burning lake of brim≈øtone, and at this time calleth for one drop of cold water to coole his tongue, which yet is denied him.</p>
               <p>What adamantine and flinty heart can thinke vpon this without relenting? I ≈øpeake not here of the harmes and hurts that intemperance in meates and drinkes bringeth to the body, for meate ≈øhould be v≈øed as oyle put into a lampe, to keepe it burning, not to quench it. And <hi>Galen</hi> the Prince of Phy≈øitians ≈øaith that ab≈øtinence is the whole ≈øumme or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of Phy≈øicke. How then can they liue long, that liue by ≈øo many deaths, who≈øe bellies are ≈øepulchers of lu≈øts, and very gulfes and ≈øinckes of the ≈øhambles, to their owne de≈øtruction? For as he that allowes le≈ø≈øe to his body then he owes to his body, kils his friend, ≈øo hee that giues more to his body then he owes to his body, nouri≈øheth his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. If the glutton did remember that God is able to come again≈øt him, yea at the very disburdening of nature, he would not make his kitchin his Church, gurmandizing his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine, his Table his Alter, his Cooke his Preacher, the odours of his meate his ≈øacrifice, ≈øwearing his prayer, quaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing his repentance, and his whole life wanton fare. Did the Drunkard but remember this; that God is ready to come quickly again≈øt him, yea euen in his drunkenne≈ø≈øe, he would not ri≈øe early to follow ≈øtrong drink, <note place="margin">E≈øa. 5.11.</note> which doth trouble the head, ouerthrow the ≈øences, cau≈øe the feete to reele, the tongue to ≈øtammer, the eyes to roule, and the whole fabrick of his little world to be po≈ø≈øe≈øt with this voluntarie madnes, lo≈ø≈øe of many friends, credit and time.</p>
               <p>It would make too great a volume to in≈øi≈øt vpon all other ≈øinnes; for the ≈øubduing wherof the meditation on Death is a

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1365:45"/> a≈ø≈øure thy ≈øelfe that there is neither skill nor meanes of art nor any kinde of learning that can be more auaileable to quaile the pride of man, conuince his malice, confound his lu≈øts, and abate his worldly pompe, and vaine-glorious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then the often remembring of the≈øe things. For in all the world there is nothing ≈øo irk≈øome, nothing ≈øo loath≈øome, and vile as the carca≈ø≈øe of a dead man, who≈øe ≈øent is ≈øo tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and infectious, that it may not lodge and continue in a hou≈øe fower dayes, but mu≈øt needs be ca≈øt out of doores as dung, and deepely buried in the mould, <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.39.</note> for feare of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ayre. Then blu≈øh for ≈øhame thou proud peacocke, who in death art ≈øo vile, and wormes meat, and ≈øhortly ≈øhall become mo≈øt loath≈øome carrion.</p>
               <p>Thinke therefore vpon the≈øe things, and thou ≈øhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue great profit thereby. When the Peacocke doth behold that comely fanne and circle of the beautifull feathers of his taile, hee jetteth vp and downe in pride, beholding euery part thereof, but when he looketh downe &amp; ≈øeeth his black feete with great mi≈øliking he vaileth his top-gallant, and ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ≈øorrow. Euen ≈øo many know by experience that when they ≈øee them≈øelues to abound in wealth and honor, they glory much &amp; are highly conceited of them≈øelues, they draw plots, and appoynt much for them≈øelues to performe for many yeares to come. This yeare (≈øay they) we will beare this office, and the next yeare that, afterward we ≈øhall haue the rule of ≈øuch a prouince, then wee will build a pallace in ≈øuch a Citty, whereunto wee will adioyne ≈øuch gardens of plea≈øure, and ≈øuch vineyards, and the like. And thus they make a very large reckoning before hand with the rich man in the Go≈øpell. Who if they did but once behold their feete, that is, if they did but ≈øee how fa≈øt they ≈øtoope toward death, <note place="margin">Luk. 12.16.</note> and con≈øidered the ≈øhortne≈ø≈øe of their life, ≈øo fraile, ≈øo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant and tran≈øitorie, and vpon Death ≈øo black and vgly, how ≈øoone would they let fall their proud plumes, for≈øake their arrogancy, and change their purpo≈øes, their manners, their mindes, their liues? In that they tend and ha≈øten as fa≈øt as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1365:46"/> they can to death, ≈øome at one miles end, ≈øome at two, ≈øome at three, and ≈øome when they haue gone a little further. And thus it commeth to pa≈ø≈øe that ≈øome are taken out of this life ≈øooner, and ≈øome tarry a little longer. Abhorre therefore thy haughtines, auoid thy vanities, leaue off thy lu≈øts, &amp; amend thy life. For he that is godly wi≈øe vieweth his death pre≈øent, and by the meditation and remembrance thereof he armeth him≈øelfe to amend.</p>
               <p>If the greate≈øt man in the world doe in a holy meditation ≈øtrip him≈øelfe out of his robes and ornaments of ≈øtate, and haue the ≈øcanning of this one poynt often in his minde; hence I mu≈øt, as great as I am, and whether then? Like men who trauelling, no ≈øooner come to their lodging, but they are talking of their next Inne, the debating of this que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the minde would bring forth mo≈øt excellent fruite; and ≈øo likewi≈øe if euery man would thus meditate and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, I mu≈øt remoue, and whither then? Hell is my de≈øert, how ≈øhall I e≈øcape it? Heauen is the onely place I de≈øire to goe to, how ≈øhall I come to it? And thus one good meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and thought would make way for another, and ≈øo lead vs on by degrees vnto the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>Marke the life and behauiour of the wicked to auoid their ≈øteps, and of the godly to prouoke thy ≈øelfe to a holy imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the like cour≈øe; as a thing be≈øt plea≈øing to God. It is one way whereby wee honor tho≈øe that are departed in the faith, when wee re≈øemble them in tho≈øe heauenly graces, which (like the ≈øtars of heauen) did ≈øhine within them, while they were aliue. Mark al≈øo their death with like diligence, &amp; think ≈øeriou≈øly vpon thy owne death, how thou mu≈øt ≈øhortly dye and lie downe in the du≈øt, and part with what≈øoeuer delight thou doe≈øt here enioy, that this may breede in thee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, and a longing after a better life.</p>

               <p>It were good that Chri≈øtians, which tender their ≈øaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

I haue read of a certaine holy man, who at fir≈øt had led a di≈ø≈øolute life, and chancing on a time into the company of an hone≈øt godly man, he in ≈øhort time ≈øo wrought by his holy per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions with his affections (≈øuch is the force of godly ≈øocietie) that he vtterly renounced his former cour≈øe of life, and gaue him≈øelfe to a more priuate, au≈øtere, moderate and ≈øeclu≈øe kinde of liuing; the cau≈øe whereof being demanded by one of his former companions, who would haue drawne him (≈øuch is the nature of euill company) to his v≈øuall riot, hee an≈øwered, that as yet he was ≈øo bu≈øied in reading and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on a little booke, which was but of three leaues, that he had no lei≈øure ≈øo much as to think of any other bu≈øine≈ø≈øe: and being asked againe, a long time after, whether hee had read ouer the≈øe three leaues; he did reply, that the≈øe three leaues were of three ≈øeuerall colours, red, white, and black, which contained ≈øo many mi≈øteries, that the more he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated thereon, the more ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe he alwayes found, ≈øo that he had deuoted him≈øelfe to reade therein all the daies of his life. In the fir≈øt leafe which is red, I meditate (quoth he) on the Pa≈ø≈øion of my Lord and Sauiour Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, and of his precious bloud ≈øhed for a ran≈øome of my ≈øinnes, and the ≈øinnes of all his Elect, without which we had been all bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈ølaues to Satan, and fewell for hell fire. In the white leafe, I cheere vp my ≈øpirit with the comfortable con≈øideration of the vn≈øpeakable ioyes of the heauenly Kingdome, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by the bloud of my Lord and Sauiour Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, a great motiue of thankfulne≈ø≈øe. In the third leafe, which is blacke, I meditatate vpon the horrible and perpetuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell for the wicked and reprobate prouided and kept in ≈øtore; who, if they behold the heauens, from thence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1365:47"/> they are iu≈øtly bani≈øhed for their ≈øinnes: If they looke vpon the earth, there are they impri≈øoned; on the right hand they haue the Saints, who≈øe ≈øteps they haue not rightly followed; on the left hand the wicked, who≈øe cour≈øe they haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øued; before them, they haue Death ready to arre≈øt them; behind them, their wicked life ready to accu≈øe them; aboue them, Gods iu≈øtice ready to condemne them; and vnder them, Hell-fire, readie to deuoure them. From which the godly are freed by the death of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>This booke of three leaues, if we would alwayes carrie in our hearts, and meditate often therein, a≈ø≈øuredly great would be the benefit which we ≈øhould make thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtraine our thoughts, words and actions, within the bounds and limits of the feare of God.</p>

               <head>THE THIRD DIVISION, OF THE PREPARATION FOR DEATH.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow by way of preparation vnto death, let vs ob≈øerue that the greate≈øt worke we haue to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh in this world is to die well; &amp; they which die well die not to die, but to liue eternally. That man doth fini≈øh his daies in his be≈øt ≈øort, that euery day e≈øteemeth the la≈øt day of his life to be pre≈øent or neere at hand, and that a man may die well, Gods word requireth a preparation for Death.</p>
               <p>The Preparation for death is an action of a repentant ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby he makes him≈øelfe fit and ready euery day to leaue this life, and to die well. And it is a dutie very nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øarie, and of great waight and importance, to which we are tied and bound by Gods Commandement, and therefore it can in no wi≈øe bee omitted of him, that de≈øires to make a happie and ble≈ø≈øed end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this preparation is two-fold, Generall and particular. Generall preparation is that whereby a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him≈øelfe to die, through the whole cour≈øe of his life. The rea≈øons are the≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, Death which is certaine, is mo≈øt vncertaine; I ≈øay it is certaine, becau≈øe no man can auoid it: and it is vncertaine three wayes. Fir≈øt, in regard of the time, for no man doth know when he ≈øhall die. Secondly, in regard of the place, becau≈øe no man knoweth where he ≈øhall die: and thirdly, in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1365:49"/> regard of the kind of death, for that no man knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ≈øhall die of an ordinary or extraordinary death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a lingring or ≈øodaine death, whether ea≈øie or violent. Therefore from thence it followes that we ≈øhould euery day and in all places prepare our ≈øelues for death.</p>
               <p>Indeede if wee could know when, where, and how wee ≈øhould dye, the ca≈øe were otherwi≈øe; but ≈øeeing we know none of all the≈øe, but are ignorant therof, therfore it ≈øtands vs greatly in hand to looke about vs to prepare our ≈øelues for our latter end.</p>
               <p>A ≈øecond rea≈øon ≈øeruing further to per≈øwade vs to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of this duety, is this, that the mo≈øt dangerous thing in all the world to the hazard of our ≈øoules, is to neglect this preparation. It mu≈øt not be put off till ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, for then it will be vnfitting by rea≈øon of the paine, and of other lets and hinderances at that time. It mu≈øt not be put off to bee done when we will, for it is not in the power of man, to doe this duetie at his plea≈øure, but when God will. <note place="margin">Ier. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord</hi> ≈øaith the Prophet) <hi>I know that the way of man is not in him≈øelfe, it is not in man</hi> (that walketh) <hi>to direct his ≈øteps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And againe, this late preparation, which con≈øi≈øteth chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in repentance, is ≈øeldome or neuer true: It is ≈øicke like the partie him≈øelfe, commonly langui≈øhing and dying together with vs. This preparation ≈øhould bee voluntary (as all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God ought to bee) but preparation taken vp in ≈øickne≈ø≈øe is v≈øually con≈øtrained and extorted by the feare of hell, and other iudgements of God. For in true and ≈øound preparation (wherein chiefely wee mu≈øt repent) men mu≈øt for≈øake all their ≈øinnes, but in this, the ≈øin for≈øakes the man, who leaues all his euill wayes only vpon this that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained, whether he will or no, to leaue the world.</p>
               <p>Therefore ponder with thy ≈øelfe, what then thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt that thou hade≈øt done, when being neere vnto death, thou ha≈øt no more time to liue, and the ≈øame thing which thou woulde≈øt wi≈øh thou hade≈øt done, when thou art at the point of death, the ≈øame thing without delay doe, while thou
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1365:50"/> art in health, that thou mai≈øt be ready euery houre to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the me≈ø≈øage of Death, as <hi>Seneca</hi> per≈øwades. <hi>Mors vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que nos expectat, tu ≈øi ≈øapiens eris vbique eam expectabis,</hi> ≈øo it ≈øhall neuer take thee at any aduantage. To this end remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Augu≈øtus</hi> his admonition, be afraid to liue in ≈øuch an e≈øtate, as thou art afraid to dy in. And pray vnto God that by his grace the≈øe things may penetrate into the bottom of thy heart, and bee there ≈øo fixed, that they may neuer bee quenched; and that from this time forward thou mai≈øt make ≈øuch v≈øe of the preaching and hearing of his holy word, of the comfortable ≈øacraments of his Church, and all other the good meanes of thy ≈øaluation that thou mai≈øt begin to walke now with a better con≈øcience before him, that in the peace of a quiet con≈øcience (after this preparation) thou mai≈øt thereby arriue at the heauen of eternall glory and happines, and ≈øay with the ble≈ø≈øed Apo≈øtle. <note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Herein doe I exerci≈øe my ≈øelfe to haue alwaies a good con≈øcience void of offence toward God and toward men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus then this poynt being manife≈øt, that a generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration mu≈øt be made, let vs now ≈øee in what manner it mu≈øt be done.

               <p>Death in it ≈øelfe is the way to hell vnto the wicked, but it is altered and changed vnto the children of God by grace,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1365:52"/> and is become vnto them a portall, by which the ≈øoule pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth out of the fraile body into heauen. In it ≈øelfe Death is as a Sergeant to arre≈øt men, and bring them to iudgment, but to the elect children of God, by the Death of Chri≈øt, it is as the Angell which guided the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter</hi> out of pri≈øon, <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> and ≈øets them at liberty, and leads them from the vale of teares into the land of righteou≈ønes; and by this meanes of a mighty and bloudie enemie, is ≈øo far forth made tractable and friendly, that wee may now with comfort encounter with Death, and preuaile, ≈øeeing now it is become a peece of our happines.</p>

               <p>The third dutie in our generall preparation, is in this life to enter into the fir≈øt degree of life eternall; for eternall life and happines hath three degrees, one in this life, and that is when a man can truly ≈øay with the Apo≈øtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I liue, and yet not I, but Chri≈øt liueth in me, and the life which I now liue in the fle≈øh, I liue by faith in the ≈øonne of God, who loued me, and gaue him≈øelfe for me;</hi> and this all ≈øuch can ≈øay as doe vnfainedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and beleeue, and that are iu≈øtified from their ≈øinnes, ≈øanctified again≈øt their ≈øinnes, and haue the peace of a good
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1365:52"/> con≈øcience, with other good gifts and graces of the holie Spirit, being the earne≈øt peny of their ≈øaluation.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond degree is in the end of this life, that is, when the bodie goes to the earth, from whence it came, and the ≈øoule returnes to God that gaue it, and is carried by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo≈øome.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the end of the world, that is, at the re≈øurrection and la≈øt iudgement, when bodie and ≈øoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reunited together, who were ancient louing familiers, liuing and ≈øuffering together, and from their fir≈øt conuer≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did draw together as ≈øweete yoke-fellowes in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, doe now ioyntly enter together into the Kingdome of glory. So that the fir≈øt of the≈øe three degrees is in this life into which we mu≈øt enter. For he that will liue in eternal happine≈ø≈øe, mu≈øt fir≈øt begin in this life to ri≈øe out of the graue of ≈øinne, in which by nature he lyes buried, and then liue in newne≈ø≈øe of life by grace.</p>
               <p>The fourth dutie in our generall preparation, is to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe and inure our ≈øelues in dying by little and little, before we come to that point that we mu≈øt needs die indeed. For he that leaues this world, before the world leaue him, giues Death the hand like a welcome me≈ø≈øenger, and departs in peace. Wherefore as they in open games of actiuitie, as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ≈øhooting, wre≈øtling and ≈øuch like, long before hand, breath their bodies, and exerci≈øe them≈øelues, that in the day of triall they may winne the game, &amp;c. Euen ≈øo ≈øhould wee beginne to die now while we are liuing, that we may be the better prepared for it when it ≈øhall come indeed.</p>
               <p>But ≈øome may heere obiect &amp; ≈øay, how can this be done? The Apo≈øtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth an≈øwere it in giuing vs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by his owne example, when he ≈øaith, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.31.</note> 
                  <hi>By our reioycing which wee haue in Christ Ie≈øus our Lord, I die daily.</hi> And doutle≈ø≈øe this Apo≈øtle died daily, not only becau≈øe he was often in danger of death by rea≈øon of his calling, but al≈øo becau≈øe in all his dangers and troubles hee inured him≈øelfe to die. For when men doe make the right v≈øe of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1365:53"/> and doe with their might endeauour to beare them patiently, humbling them≈øelues, as vnder the Lords cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øti≈øement and correction, then they are ≈øaid to begin to die well. And he that would mortifie his greate≈øt ≈øinnes, mu≈øt fir≈øt begin to doe it in his ≈ømalle≈øt ≈øinnes; which being once reformed, he ≈øhall with more ea≈øe be able to ouercome his ma≈øter ≈øinnes. For this is the way to keepe ≈øinne from raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in our mortall bodies. So likewi≈øe he that would bee able to beare the cro≈ø≈øe of all cro≈ø≈øes, as namely death, which is the end of all cro≈ø≈øes, mu≈øt fir≈øt of all learne to beare ≈ømall cro≈ø≈øes, as ≈øickne≈ø≈øes, di≈øea≈øes, troubles, lo≈ø≈øes, pouertie and the like, which may fitly be tearmed little deathes, and the beginnings of the greater death; with which little deaths we mu≈øt fir≈øt acquaint our ≈øelues, before wee can be able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with great Death. For as one well ≈øaith, <hi>Death after the cro≈ø≈øe is the le≈ø≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The world is ≈øet vnto vs as a hou≈øe, wherein we are but tenants at will; out of which the Lord by ≈øickne≈ø≈øe and cro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes giueth vs warning, and by death determineth his will, and requireth it againe at our hands, and willeth vs thereby to prepare our ≈øelues for a better hou≈øe; and the new hou≈øe for which we are to prepare our ≈øelues is mo≈øt plea≈øant, and not ≈øo fraile, ruinous and weake, as our worldly hou≈øe; for the tiles doe ≈øometimes fall off this hou≈øe, the walles doe reele, the roofe doth drop, the pillars doe leane, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth ≈øinke; And what are the≈øe, but ≈øo many warnings of the Lord to vs to depart hence, and prepare for a better place? Therfore when thou do≈øt perceiue thy falling haires, thy watering eyes, thy trembling hands, thy weake knees, and thy ≈øtooping bodie; what are the≈øe, but onely the citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Death, which ≈øeemes to warne thee to prepare to packe vp, that thou mai≈øt with more ea≈øe be able to goe out of this ruinous hou≈øe of thine.</p>
               <p>It is a fable, but it hath a good mortall: A certaine man did couenant with Death that he ≈øhould neuer ≈øurprize him at vnawares or ≈øodainly, before that he had fir≈øt ≈øent a me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenger
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1365:53"/> to him to giue him warning that ≈øhortly hee would arre≈øt him; to which Death a≈ø≈øented, that though he could not alwaies forbeare him, yet before hee did ≈øtrike him, hee would giue him warning. Vpon Deaths promi≈øe thus pa≈øt, this man liued ≈øecure, ≈øpending his time in all maner of riot and exce≈ø≈øe; and when he thoughtfull little of Death, then came Death to take him away; with whom this man expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtulating for breach of promi≈øe: Death in di≈øcharging of his fidelitie, replied, that with none, no not tho≈øe that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all promi≈øes, had he broken promi≈øe, for (≈øaith he) I haue ≈øent many me≈ø≈øenger vnto you, from time to time, to giue you warning of my comming; thou wa≈øt ≈øixe yeares ≈øince taken with a grieuous Feuer; within the≈øe two yeeres ≈øore troubled with Rhumes and di≈øtillations; ≈øince that, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the cough and paine in the head, &amp; then troubled with the con≈øumption of the Lungs: And did I not lately ≈øend my brother Germaine vnto thee, the drou≈øie ≈øleeping di≈øea≈øe <hi>veturno≈øum ≈øoporem,</hi> in which thou did≈øt lye for a while like a dead man? All the≈øe were fore-runners of my comming, to warne thee to make thy ≈øelfe ready for mee, who was neere at hand. Is there any among≈øt vs, that is not ≈øometimes admoni≈øhed of Deathes approaching by ≈øome of the≈øe his Apparators, that hee mu≈øt ≈øhortly depart? The Poet ≈øaith truely:

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>From whence let all men learne, that haue care of their ≈øaluation, what they ought to doe, and be warie to prepare them≈øelues for Death, before Death doth end their life.

And while we haue eares, <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.4:</note> before the≈øe daughters of ≈øinging bee aba≈øed, let vs lift vp our eares to heare the word of God, and not to vanitie.</p>

               <p>In a temporall building the ≈øtones mu≈øt be broken, cut, hewen, and ≈øquared, ere they be fit to make vp the worke. The corne mu≈øt bee cut downe, bound vp, carried into the barne, thre≈øhed, winnowed, clen≈øed and grinded, before it be ready for good bread. And the whirlewinde mu≈øt fir≈øt blow, <note place="margin">2. King. 2.11.</note> before <hi>Eliah</hi> be rapt vp into heauen. And wee mu≈øt be cut, hewen and ≈øquared with a number of Deathes me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øengers before wee can bee made fit for the Lords building. We mu≈øt be to≈ø≈øed with the winde and weather, before wee can arriue in the hauen of heauen. The very victualls which wee eate, mu≈øt fir≈øt from life be brought to the fire, and bee cleane altered in lo≈øing their propertie, from the fire to the table, from the table to the mouth, ≈øo to the ≈øtomacke, and there be concocted and di≈øge≈øted, before they can nouri≈øh and worke their perfection in vs. Euen ≈øo Gods children mu≈øt be mangled and defaced in this world, which is the mill to grinde vs the kitchin to receiue vs, and the fire to boyle, roa≈øt and bake vs, to alter the propertie from that wee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1365:54"/> were at the fir≈øt, that we thereby may bee made fitte to be brought to the Lords table. For as raw fle≈øh is whole≈øome meate for men, ≈øo vnmortified men bee no creatures fit for God.</p>
               <p>By all which meanes the Lord brings vs to mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which be the little Deathes, that thereby we may be the better armed and prepared for the great death, when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to endure the ≈øame with more ea≈øe. For wee mu≈øt learne to giue intertainment, to the Herbengers, ≈øeruants, and me≈ø≈øengers of Death, that we may the better intertaine the Lord and Ma≈øter when he commeth.</p>
               <p>This point, that ble≈ø≈øed martyr, Saint <hi>Bylney,</hi> well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, who oftentimes before his burning and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, did put his finger into the flame of a candle, not only to make triall of his abilitie in ≈øuffering, but al≈øo to arme, ≈øtrengthen, and prepare him≈øelfe again≈øt greater torments and paines in his death, which hee did ≈øuffer with the more ea≈øe. And thus you ≈øee the fourth dutie which we mu≈øt in any wi≈øe learne and remember, becau≈øe otherwi≈øe wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øo well able to beare and endure the pangs of death well, except we be fir≈øt well ≈øchooled, nurtured, and trained vp by inuring our ≈øelues to die through the ≈øundrie afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and trials of this life.</p>
               <p>The fift and la≈øt duety of our generall preparation is ≈øet downe vnto vs by the Preacher, who ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Eccl. 9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>All that thine hand ≈øhall finde to doe, doe it with all thy power.</hi> And marke the rea≈øon, <hi>For there is neither worke, nor inuention, nor knowledge, nor wi≈ødome in the graue, whither thou goe≈øt.</hi> Therefore if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man be able to doe any good ≈øeruice or office, either to the Church of God or Common-wealth, or to any publike or priuate per≈øon, let him doe it with all ≈øpeed, and with all his might, le≈øt by Death he bee preuented. He that hath care thus to ≈øpend his dayes, ≈øhall with much comfort and peace of con≈øcience end his dayes. Thus much of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preparation for death.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the perticular preparation for Death, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1365:55"/> this is in the time of ≈øickne≈ø≈øe; and in the right and true manner of making this particuler preparation, are contained three ≈øorts of duties: one concerning God, another mans ≈øelfe, and the third, our neighbour.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt concerning God is to ≈øeek to be reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in Chri≈øt, and by Chri≈øt, though wee haue bin long ≈øince a≈ø≈øured of his fauour: all other duties mu≈øt come after in the ≈øecond place, and they are of no value or effect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this.</p>
               <p>Touching the duties which hee is to performe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, they are two-fold, the one concerning his ≈øoule, the other his body.</p>
               <p>The dutie concerning his ≈øoule, is, that he mu≈øt arme and furni≈øh him≈øelfe again≈øt the immoderate feare of pre≈øent death, and the rea≈øon hereof is very plaine, becau≈øe how ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer naturally men feare Death through the whole cour≈øe of their liues more or le≈ø≈øe, yet in time of ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, when death approacheth, this naturall feare bred in the bone, will mo≈øt of all ≈øhew it ≈øelfe euen in ≈øuch ≈øort, as it will a≈øtoni≈øh the ≈øences of the ≈øicke partie. And therefore it is nece≈ø≈øarie that we ≈øhould v≈øe ≈øome meanes to ≈øtrengthen our ≈øelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the feare of Death: which meanes are of two ≈øorts, Practi≈øe and Meditation. Practi≈øe, that the ≈øicke man mu≈øt not ≈øo much regard Death it ≈øelfe, as the benefits of God whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h are obtained after death. He mu≈øt not fixe his minde vpon the con≈øideration of the pangs and torments of death, but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>l his thoughts and affections mu≈øt bee vpon that ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed e≈øtate that he is to enioy after death. He that is to ≈øwim ouer ≈øome great and deepe Riuer, mu≈øt not looke downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the violent running of the ≈øtreame, but if he would pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>uent feare, hee mu≈øt ca≈øt his eyes to the bancke on the further ≈øide, to the which place he is to pa≈ø≈øe: and euen ≈øo, he that drawes neere vnto death, mu≈øt looke, as it were ouer the waues of death, and directly fixe the eyes of his faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eternall life and happine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>The meditations which ≈øerue for this purpo≈øe are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1365:55"/> three: the fir≈øt is borrowed from the ≈øpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, namely that the Death of euery man, much more of euery child of God is not onely fore≈øeene, but al≈øo appoynted by God. Yea the death of euery man de≈øerued and procured by his owne ≈øinnes, is laid vpon him by God, who in this re≈øpect may bee ≈øaid to be the cau≈øe of euery mans death. <note place="margin">Acts 4.28.</note> The Church of <hi>Ieru≈øalem</hi> confe≈ø≈øed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing came to pa≈ø≈øe in the Death of Chri≈øt, but that which the foreknowledge and eternall coun≈øell of God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; therefore al≈øo the Death of euery member of Chri≈øt is fore≈øeene and foreordained by the ≈øpeciall decree and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God. I adde further that the very circum≈øtances of Death, as the time, place, and manner, the beginning of the ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, the continuance, the end of it, euery fit in the ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the pangs of Death are ≈øet downe particularly in the coun≈øell of God. For vnto the Lord (≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt) belong the i≈ø≈øues of Death. <note place="margin">P≈øal. 68.20.</note> The carefull con≈øideration of this one point will bee a notable meanes to arme vs again≈øt all feare, di≈øtru≈øt and impatience in the time of ≈øicknes, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo of our Death.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond meditation is to be borrowed from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promi≈øe that God hath made to the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, which is this, <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed are they that dye in the Lord, for they re≈øt from their labours and their workes follow them;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reue. 14.13.</note> this the Author of truth that can not lye, hath ≈øpoken.</p>
               <p>Now then let a man but throughly con≈øider this, that Death ioyned and accompanied with a reformed life hath a promi≈øe of ble≈ø≈øednes adioyned with it, and it alone will be a ≈øufficient meanes to ≈øtay the rage of our affections, and all immoderate feare of Death.</p>
               <p>The third meditation, is that God hath promi≈øed his ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, ble≈ø≈øed and comfortable pre≈øence to his ≈øeruants in their ≈øicknes, and at their death. And the Lord doth manife≈øt his pre≈øence three wayes. The fir≈øt is by moderating and le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øening the paines and torments of ≈øicknes and Death; and hence it comes to pa≈ø≈øe, that to many men the ≈øorrowes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1365:56"/> and pangs of ≈øicknes and death are nothing ≈øo greiuous and trouble≈øome, as the cro≈ø≈øes and afflictions which they ≈øuffer in the cour≈øe of their liues. The ≈øecond way of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence is by an inward and vn≈øpeakeable comfort of his holy ≈øpirit (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaith) <hi>We reioyce in tribulation;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.4.</note> but why is this reioycing? <hi>Becau≈øe</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>the loue of God is ≈øhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts by the holy Gho≈øt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Chro. 2.5.</note> 
                  <hi>which is giuen vnto vs.</hi> Againe this Apo≈øtle hauing in grieuous ≈øickne≈ø≈øe receiued the ≈øentence of Death, ≈øaith of him≈øelfe, that as the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øt did abound in him, ≈øo his con≈øolation did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound through Chri≈øt.

Phy≈øick for the body is nothing worth: therefore it is a thing much to be mi≈øliked that in all places almo≈øt the Phy≈øitian is fir≈øt ≈øent for, and comes in the beginning of the ≈øicknes, &amp; the Mini≈øter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>es when a man is halfe dead, and is then ≈øent for oftentimes, when the ≈øick partie lyes drawing on and ga≈øping for breath; as though Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell in the≈øe dayes were able to worke miracles.

               <p>The doctrine then from hence is, that the helps of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øick are not to be de≈øpi≈øed, not too much to be depended on; but our chiefe≈øt hope is to bee fixed vpon God, who as hee onely puts the ≈øoule into the body, ≈øo he onely can take it away againe when it plea≈øeth him.

               <p>Now touching the manner of v≈øing the means, the≈øe rules mu≈øt be followed. Fir≈øt of all, he that is to take phy≈øick, mu≈øt not onely prepare his bodie, as Phy≈øitians doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly pre≈øcribe, but he mu≈øt al≈øo prepare his ≈øoule by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him≈øelfe vnder the mercifull hand of God in his ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe for his ≈øinnes; and making earne≈øt prayers vnto him for pardon, before any medicine come in his body.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond rule is, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.5.</note> that when wee haue prepared our ≈øelues, and are about to v≈øe the phy≈øick, we mu≈øt ≈øanctifie it as wee doe our meate and drinke, by the word of God and prayer.</p>
               <p>The third rule is, that wee mu≈øt carry in minde the right and proper end of Phy≈øicke, le≈øt we deceiue our ≈øelues. We mu≈øt not therefore thinke that Phy≈øicke ≈øerueth to preuent old age, or death it ≈øelfe; for that is impo≈ø≈øible: neither doe we eate, drinke and ≈øleepe, that we may neuer die; but that we may prolong our l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1365:58"/> man, yet may it ea≈øily be ≈øhortened by intemperance in dyet, by gluttony, by drunkenne≈ø≈øe, by violent di≈øea≈øes, and ≈øuch like. But care mu≈øt be had to auoide all the≈øe euils, and the like, that the little lampe of corporall life may burne, till it goe out of it ≈øelfe by Gods appoyntment, and vntill God hath fulfilled the number of our dayes. <note place="margin">Exod. 23.26.</note> And this very ≈øpace of time is the day of grace and ≈øaluation. And whereas God in his iu≈øtice might haue cut vs off, and vtterly de≈øtroyed vs long before this day, yet in his great mercie he doth giue vs thus much time, that we might prepare our ≈øelues for our end. Which time when it is once ≈øpent, (which may be nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer then we are aware) if a man would redeeme it with the price of ten thou≈øand worlds, <note place="margin">Mat. 16.26.</note> it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>not be obtained. <hi>For what is a man profited</hi> (≈øaith our Sauiour) <hi>if he ≈øhall gaine the whole world, and lo≈øe his ≈øoule?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hauing thus ≈øeene what bee the duties of the ≈øicke man to him≈øelfe: now let vs ≈øee what be the duties which he oweth to his neighbour. And they are two: Fir≈øt, the dutie of reconciliation, whereby hee is freely to forgiue all men, and to de≈øire to bee forgiuen by all. In the old Te≈øtament when a man was to offer a Bullocke or a Lambe in ≈øacrifice to God, <note place="margin">Matth. 5.23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>He mu≈øt leaue his offering at the Altar, and fir≈øt goe and be reconciled to his brother, if he had ought again≈øt him, and then come and offer his gift;</hi> much more then mu≈øt this bee done, when wee are dying, to offer vp our ≈øelues, ≈øoules and bodies, as an acceptable and rea≈øonable ≈øeruice and ≈øacrifice to God, in forgiuing of all men. And if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee ab≈øent, or will not bee reconciled, yet the ≈øicke partie by forgiuing, hath di≈øcharged his owne con≈øcience, and God will accept his will for the deede in ≈øuch a ca≈øe. <hi>For if yee forgiue men their tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes</hi> (≈øaith our Sauiour) <hi>your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father will al≈øo forgiue you;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 6.14.15.</note> 
                  <hi>but if yee forgiue not men their tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, neither will your Father forgiue you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ≈øecond dutie is, that tho≈øe which are Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of others mu≈øt haue great care that they which be committed to their charge and gouernment, may be left in
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1365:58"/> good e≈øtate after their death; wherein are three duties to be handled, the fir≈øt of the Magi≈øtrate, the ≈øecond of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øter of the Go≈øpell, and the third of the Ma≈øter or Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the family.</p>
               <p>The Magi≈øtrates dutie before his death, is to prouide as farre forth as he can, for the godly and peaceable ≈øtate and gouernment of all ≈øuch as are vnder his charge and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that is done partly by procuring the maintenance of pietie, godline≈ø≈øe, and ≈øound religion, and partly by e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhing of good and whole≈øome lawes for their ≈øafetie, peace, and quietne≈ø≈øe. Whereof there are examples of the practi≈øe of the≈øe duties in Gods word. <note place="margin">Deut. 31.1.</note> When <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was an hundred and twentie yeeres old, and was not longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to goe in and out before the people, he called them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ≈øignified that the time of his departure was at hand, and therefore he tooke order for their welfare after his death. And fir≈øt of all hee placed <hi>Io≈øua</hi> ouer them, in his ≈øtead, to be their guide to the promi≈øed Land. Secondly, he gaue ≈øpeciall charge to all the people, to be valiant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious again≈øt all their enemies, and to obey the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of their God. And <hi>Io≈øhua</hi> followes the ≈øame cour≈øe, <note place="margin">Io≈øhua 24.1,</note> for he called the people together, and telles them that the time of his death is at hand, and giues them a charge to bee couragious, and to wor≈øhippe the true God; which being done, he ends his dayes as a worthy Captaine of the Lord. And ≈øo when King <hi>Dauid</hi> was to go the way of all fle≈øh, <note place="margin">2. King. 1.1.</note> and lay ≈øicke on his death-bed, he placed his owne ≈øonne <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> vpon his throne, and gaue him charge, both for the maintenance of true religion, and for the execution of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill iu≈øtice.</p>
               <p>Touching the dutie of Mini≈øters of the Go≈øpell, when they are going out of the world, they mu≈øt ca≈øt about and prouide, as much as in them lies, that the Church of God, ouer which God hath made them ouer≈øeers, may flouri≈øh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are gone. An example whereof we haue in Saint <hi>Paul, Take heede therefore</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>vnto your ≈øelues,</hi>

For I know this, that after my departure ≈øhall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous wolues enter in amongst you, not ≈øparing the flocke. Al≈øo of your owne ≈øelues ≈øhall men ari≈øe, ≈øpeaking peruer≈øe things, to draw away di≈øciples after them. Therefore watch, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that by the ≈øpace of three yeeres, I cea≈øed not to warne euery one night and day with teares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this dutie had been well ob≈øerued and performed, there could not haue beene ≈øuch abundance of errors and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øies in the Church of God, as hath beene and are at this day. But becau≈øe men haue had more care to maintaine per≈øonall ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, then the right ≈øucce≈ø≈øion, which ≈øtands and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts in the whole≈øome word and doctrine of the Prophets and Apo≈øtles, therefore Wolues, and vnprofitable teachers haue come into the places and roomes of faithfull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pa≈øtors and teachers, not ≈øparing the flocke of Chri≈øt, but haue made hauocke of the ≈øame; the Apo≈øtacie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath ouer≈øpread the face of the Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hou≈øholders and ma≈øters of families, mu≈øt haue great care to ≈øet their hou≈øhold and family in good order before they die. Which dutie the Lord him≈øelfe, by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>E≈øay,</hi> doth command that good King <hi>Ezechiah</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. <note place="margin">I≈øa. 38.1.</note>

               <p>The fir≈øt is to die in, or by faith. And to die by faith, is, when a man in the time of death, doth with all his heart wholly rely him≈øelfe on Gods e≈øpeciall loue, fauour &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in Chri≈øt, as it is reuealed in his holy word.

                  <note place="margin">1 King. 21.20.</note> but when it is told the child of God that Death is come within his dores<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to looke him in the face, he to ≈øhew his courage and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, may ≈øay as <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaith of <hi>Ahymaaz,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.27.</note> let him come and welcome, for he is my friend and a good man, and hee commeth with good tidings; ≈øo he, Death is my friend, let him come, he is a good man and bringeth good tidings. As for the wicked they doe with <hi>Felix,</hi> tremble, <note place="margin">Acts 24.26.</note> if they doe but heare of death and of iudgment, and are like vnto <hi>Saul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ≈øtrength in them, but fall into a ≈øound when they heare of death, and if they could but ≈øee it, they would ca≈øt a jauelin as <hi>Saul</hi> at <hi>Dauid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.11.</note> to ≈ølay it.</p>
               <p>But the children of God doe willingly welcome Death, as Gods ≈øeruant and me≈ø≈øenger, and applaud it as <hi>Iacob</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded the Chariots that <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> his ≈øonne ≈øent for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of him out of a Countrey of mi≈øery into a land of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Gen. 45.27.48</note> where he ≈øhould haue food enough, the be≈øt in the land. So the hope and expectation of the Saints is that they ≈øhall ≈øee God, and come to Chri≈øt by Death pre≈øently in their ≈øoules, and in their bodies at the la≈øt day. So they may ≈øay of Death as <hi>Adoniah</hi> ≈øaid vnto <hi>Ionathan</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athar</hi> the Prie≈øt come in, for thou art a valiant man, <note place="margin">1 Kings 1.42.</note> and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt good tidings.</p>
               <p>Cruell and vnmercifull Death makes a league with no man, <note place="margin">E≈øay 28.15.</note> and yet the Prophet <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øayth that the wicked man doth make a league with death: how may this be? There is no league made indeede, but onely in the wicked imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, who fal≈øely thinkes that Death will not come neere him, though all the world ≈øhould be de≈øtroied. And therefore the ≈øeperation of the ≈øoule from the body will be bitter to the wicked, which cannot bee ≈øeperated without great griefe, woe, and lamentation. As the Oxe doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lowe and mourne, when his yoke-fellow wont to draw with him, is taken away, ≈øo the wicked then mourne, when the ≈øoule ≈øhall be ≈øeperated from the body; then will
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1365:72"/> the ≈øoule and the bodie with teares repeat againe and againe, do≈øt thou thus ≈øeperate vs bitter Death? <hi>O Death &amp;c.</hi> Then griefes follow griefes, and ≈øorrow comes vpon ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and then what a wound doth the heart of the wicked receiue which loueth this pre≈øent life? When the Phy≈øitian ≈øaith vnto him, thou mu≈øt from henceforth thinke no more on life but of Death; at the hearing of which heauie newes, the body ≈øhall dye once whether he will or no, but the heart ≈øhall dye ≈øo often, as the things and ≈øinnes be in number which he loued. Then ≈øhall the mo≈øt cleere light be turned into darkene≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe tho≈øe things which aforetime were occa≈øions of great ioy, ≈øhall now become mo≈øt horrible vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and torment, which will make the wicked ≈øet their throates vpon tainter hookes, and lift vp their voyces like trumpets, and cry out at that time vpon Death, as the deuils did vpon Chri≈øt in the Go≈øpell, ≈øaying what haue we to doe with thee O cruell Death, <note place="margin">Mat. 8.29. Iob 2.4.</note> art thou come hither to torment vs before the time? And therefore well ≈øaid the deuill <hi>pellem pro pelle,</hi> skin for skin, and all that euer a man hath will hee giue for his life, ≈øo that he may enioy that, although but for a moment longer. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ≈øaid to <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> depart from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my people, ≈øo ≈øay the vngodly to death bee bani≈øhed from vs, thy pre≈øence, thy ≈øhadow &amp; the very remembrance of thee is fearefull to vs, to heare Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øpeake of Gods terrible iudgment to come is too trembling a doctrine for their delightfull di≈øpo≈øitions, to heare with <hi>Felix</hi> they are not at lea≈øure, for this is iarring mu≈øicke which ≈øounds not arright in the con≈øort of their worldly plea≈øures, to thinke of death is <hi>Aceldama</hi> (≈øaith one) euen a field of blood: but if any Phy≈øition would take vpon him to make men liue euer in this world what a multitude of patients ≈øhould he haue? And how well would they reward him?</p>
               <p>But the children of God reioyce at the newes of Death, to ≈øhew their obedience to it, and their ioy is according to the ioy of harue≈øt (as the Prophet ≈øpeaketh) and as men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce when they deuide the ≈øpoyle. <note place="margin">I≈øa. 9.3.</note> And they may ≈øay of

                  <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will reioyce and be glad in it.</hi> And they may call Death, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did the place where he came, <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> becau≈øe there the Angels of God met him, when hee was to meete with his cruell brother <hi>E≈øau,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 32.1.2.</note> euen ≈øo when the children of God are to meete with cruell Death, the Lord will ≈øend his holy Angels, <note place="margin">Hebr. 1.14.</note> (who are all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtring ≈øpirits, ≈øent forth to mini≈øter for them who ≈øhall be heires of ≈øaluation) to carrie them into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bo≈øome.</p>
               <p>Tell one of our gallants in his ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, that Death is come for him, <note place="margin">2.

                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.18.</note> But this newes comming to the childe of God in his ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, hee may be talked withall; for he hath learned with <hi>Samuel</hi> to ≈øay, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ≈øeruant heareth:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now the rea≈øon of this great difference betwixt the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and the godly, why they are thus diuer≈øly affected vnto Death, is this; the wicked enioy their haue-be≈øt in this life, but the godly looke for their good, and are walking toward it. And if it ≈øhould be demanded when a wicked man is at his be≈øt: the an≈øwere is, the be≈øt is euill enough, and that his be≈øt is, when he comes fir≈øt into the world; for then his ≈øins are fewe≈øt, his iudgements ea≈øie≈øt; they goe a≈øtray as ≈øoone as they are borne, ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt. <note place="margin">P≈øal. 58.3.</note> It had beene good for him therefore, that the knees had not preuented him, but that he had died in the birth; Nay, <hi>it had beene good for him,</hi>

               <p>But if you wil aske when the children of God are at their be≈øt, I an≈øwere, prai≈øed be God, our wor≈øt is away, our good is begun, <note place="margin">Iohn 7.6.</note> our be≈øt is at hand. As our Sauiour ≈øaid to his kin≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ≈øo may we ≈øay to the worldlings, <hi>Your time is alwayes, but my time is not yet come:</hi> the children of God are not at their be≈øt now, it is in the working, onely wee were at our wor≈øt before our conuer≈øion; For our whole life till then was a walking with the children of di≈øobedience, in the broad way that leads to damnation; and then were wee at the wor≈øt when wee had proceeded furthe≈øt in the way of vnrighteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe then we were furthe≈øt from God.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1365:73"/> Our be≈øt, began in the day of our recalling, wherin the Lord by his word and holy Spirit called vpon vs, and made vs turne our backes vpon Satan, and our face toward the Lord, and cau≈øed vs to part company with the children of di≈øobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, among≈øt whom wee had our conuer≈øation before; then we came home with the penitent forlorne, to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers family, but they went forward in their ≈øins to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That was a day of diui≈øion betwixt vs and our ≈øinnes; in that day with I≈ørael we entred into the borders of Canaan into Gilgal, and there we were circumci≈øed, <note place="margin">Io≈øua 5.9.</note> and the ≈øhame of Egypt was taken from us, euen our ≈øinne, which is our ≈øhame indeed, and which we haue borne from our mothers wombe. The Lord grant that wee may keepe it for euer in thankfull remembrance and that we may count it a double ≈øhame to returne againe to the bondage of Egypt, to ≈øerue the Prince of darkne≈ø≈øe in bricke and clay, that is, to haue fellow≈øhip any more with the vnfruitful workes of darknes, but that like the redeemed of the Lord, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 84.7.</note> we may walke from ≈øtrength to ≈øtrength, till wee appeare before the face of our God in Sion. For heere wee are not at our be≈øt, but our be≈øt is to come Now our life is hid with the Lord, and wee know not yet what we ≈øhall be; <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.2.</note> but wee know when hee ≈øhall appeare, we ≈øhall be like him, the Lord ≈øhall carry vs by his mercy, and bring vs in his ≈øtrength to his holy habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; hee ≈øhall plant vs in the mountaine of his inheritance, <note place="margin">Exod. 15.13.</note> euen the place which he hath prepared, <note place="margin">I≈øa. 35.10.</note> and the Sanctuary which he hath e≈øtabli≈øhed. Then euerla≈øting ioy ≈øhall be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our heads, and ≈øorrow and mourning ≈øhall fly away from vs for euer.</p>
               <p>Therefore for this cau≈øe, we mu≈øt fir≈øt indeuour that our death be voluntary; for to die well, is to die willingly. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we mu≈øt labour that our ≈øinnes die before vs. And thirdly, that wee bee alwayes ready and prepared for it. O what an excellent thing it is for a man to end his life before his death, that at the houre of death he hath nothing to doe, but only to be willing to die, that he haue no need of time,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1365:74"/> nor of him≈øelfe, but ≈øweetly and obediently to depart this life, ≈øhewing therby his obedience to the ordinance of God; for wee mu≈øt make as much con≈øcience in performing our obedience vnto God in ≈øuffering death, as wee doe in the whole cour≈øe of our liues.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour Chri≈øt is a notable example and paterne for vs to follow in this ca≈øe. And therefore the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <hi>Let this minde be in you,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.5.6.7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>which was al≈øo in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the forme of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God, but made him≈øelfe of no reputation, and tooke vpon him the forme of a ≈øeruant, and was made in the likene≈ø≈øe of men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found in fa≈øhion as a man, hee humbled him≈øelfe and became obedient vnto death, euen vnto the death of the cro≈ø≈øe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although the wicked bee ill affected vnto death, (as we haue alreadie heard) and would (if it lay in their power) mo≈øt villanou≈øly intreate and handle death, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.4.</note> as <hi>Hamon</hi> the ≈øonne of <hi>Naa≈øh</hi> King of the Ammonites, did the me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of King <hi>Dauid;</hi> yet let euery good man (when Death ≈øhall come for him, as it may ≈øeeme to him vntimely, before the threed of his life be halfe ≈øpunne out) be heere informed to entertaine it kindly, <note place="margin">Gen. 19.1.</note> as <hi>Lot</hi> did the Angels, who came to fetch him out of Sodom. For though he bee pulled from his ≈øeate, which was to him, as the plaine of Sodom ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to <hi>Lot,</hi> as a plea≈øant Paradi≈øe, yet ≈øhall hee finde with <hi>Lot,</hi> that hee is taken away from the iudgement to come, how≈øoeuer he be taken away, either by the malice of wicked men, or by the mercie of God; and that he is ≈øeparated from the ≈øinnes of this world, which grieued his ≈øoule; yea from ≈øinning him≈øelfe, and from his owne ≈øinnes, which grieued the Lord his ≈øo gratious and kinde Father. How can it be, but that Death ≈øhould be a welcome gue≈øt, &amp; this a choice ble≈ø≈øing, which as a gentle guide leades vs to Chri≈øt, carrieth the ≈øoule to her beloued Husband? The re≈øolution of Saint <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> was neither to loath life, nor feare to die, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently yeeld vnto Death, becau≈øe (≈øaith he) we haue a good Lord to goe vnto.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1365:74"/>
               <p>The third duetie is to die in repentance, which mu≈øt bee performed by vs at all times, and e≈øpecially at this time. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ≈øaith of him≈øelfe, that he is a notorious ≈øinner, and borne for nothing but repentance; and hee which is borne for repentance, mu≈øt practi≈øe repentance as long as he liues in this ≈øinfull world, into which hee is borne vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that hee mu≈øt leaue it againe, and repent at his end al≈øo.</p>
               <p>Repentance is a very ≈øore di≈øplea≈øure, which a man hath in his heart for his ≈øinnes, euen becau≈øe they are the breach of Gods holy Lawes and Commandements, &amp; an offence to God his mo≈øt mercifull and louing Father, which ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth in him a true hatred again≈øt ≈øinne, and a ≈øetled purpo≈øe and holy de≈øire to liue better in time to come, ordering his life and death by the will of God reuealed in his holy word.</p>
               <p>Repentance con≈øi≈øteth of foure parts: the fir≈øt of confe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion; by which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Dan. 9.4.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Contrition. <note place="margin">P≈øal. 51.17.</note> 
                  <hi>The ≈øacrifices of God</hi> (≈øaith the Prophet) <hi>are a broken ≈øpirit; and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not di≈øpi≈øe.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">I≈øa. 57.15.</note> 
                  <hi>For thus ≈øaith the high and loftie one that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth eternitie, who≈øe name is holy. I dwell in the high and holy place, with him al≈øo that is of an humble and contrite ≈øpirit, to reuiue the ≈øpirit of the humble, and to reuiue the heart of the contrite ones. For all the≈øe things hath my hand made,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">I≈øa. 66.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and all the≈øe things haue beene</hi> (≈øaith the Lord) <hi>but to this man will I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ≈øpirit, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1365:75"/> at my words.</hi> So that this contrition is the brui≈øing of a ≈øinners heart (as it were) to du≈øt and powder, through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained and deepe griefe conceiued of Gods di≈øplea≈øure for ≈øinne; and this is Euangelicall contrition, and is a worke of grace, the beginning of renewed repentance. Therefore the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Godly ≈øorrow worketh repentance vnto ≈øaluation not to be repented of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is faith. For without faith, neither by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nor by any other meanes are we able to plea≈øe God, neither indeede can there bee any true repentance without faith.</p>
               <p>The fourth and la≈øt point is amendment. To amend, is to redre≈ø≈øe and reforme faults; repentance is as the roote, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment the fruit. <note place="margin">Matth. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Bring forth therefore fruit</hi> (≈øaith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>) <hi>meete for repentance, or an≈øwerable to amendment of life. Repent</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and turne to God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts 26.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and doe works meet for repentance;</hi> ≈øo that fir≈øt there mu≈øt be a change of the heart from euill to good, by the gift of repentance put into it of God, and then will follow amendment of our liues and manners.</p>
               <p>There is no part of Chri≈øtian religion, of that maine importance, wherein men doe more voluntarily deceiue them≈øelues, then commonly they doe in this dutie of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

We mu≈øt follow repentance as the widdow in the Go≈øpell did her ≈øuite, <note place="margin">Luke 18.40.</note> and keepe our hold as <hi>Iacob</hi> did in wre≈øtling. <note place="margin">Gen. 32.26.</note> Amend to day, amend to morrow, runne on, not for a time, but euen our whole time with a continued act; immoderately at the fir≈øt time, con≈øtantly in the mid≈øt, and cheerefully to the end.

               <p>And let vs con≈øider well the manifold dangers which follow the want either of ≈øpeede, or continuance in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Fir≈øt our liues of all things are mo≈øt vncertaine, as we haue at large ob≈øerued in the fir≈øt diui≈øion.</p>

               <p>Secondly bad cu≈øtomes are dangerous, and greatly to be feared. Hee that from his youth hath wickedlie in his old age ≈øhall haue ≈øinne in his bones, <note place="margin">Iob 20.11.</note>

               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1365:77"/>
               <p>Thirdly, we mu≈øt remember that the longer we continue in ≈øin without repentance, the further wee runne from God. And there is no great likelyhood that hee that hath beene running from God forty, fiftie, or perhaps three or foure ≈øcore yeares together, and with the Prodigall runneth into a farre Countrey, can returne againe in the ≈øpace of ≈øix dayes, ≈øix howers, ≈øix minutes; for it may bee his ≈øicknes (vnto which time he deferreth his repentance) will not be ≈øo long as the ≈øhorte≈øt of the≈øe times, how then is it po≈ø≈øible to turne in time to our God by repentance? Neither is this a worke of one day or two, as it is ≈øaid in the book of <hi>Ezra</hi> in another ca≈øe. <hi>Salomon</hi> giueth a young man coun≈øell to remember his Creator in the daies of his youth, <note place="margin">Ezra. 10.13.</note> earely to begin repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, in the prime and bud of his life, <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.1.</note> while hee is fre≈øh and gallant, and not to tarry till the dead winter of age cau≈øe his buds to fade, and leafe to fall, or till the brawne of his ≈øtrong armes fall away, or till the keepers of the hou≈øe (the hands which defend the body) tremble, or til euery thing bee a burthen, feeing euen then the gra≈ø≈øe-hopper ≈øhall bee a burthen; or till they wax darke (the eyes) that looke out at the windowes, or till the grinders cea≈øe, that is, his teeth fall out of his head, or till the doores of his lippes bee ≈øhut, and iawes fallen, or till the daughters of ≈øinging (the eares) be aba≈øed, being not able any longer to heare the voice or ≈øound of In≈øtruments, or till it bee too late to knocke, <note place="margin">Eccle. 12.3.4.</note> when the Lords doore is made fa≈øt, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.10.12.</note> and there ≈øhall bee no more opening.</p>

               <p>But ≈øome will obiect, what is there no hope of ≈øaluation for him that repenteth at the la≈øt houre? An≈øwer. I will not ≈øay (≈øaith Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi>) he ≈øhall be ≈øaued, I will not ≈øay he ≈øhall be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ned. You wil ≈øay, the theefe was ≈øaued at the very la≈øt ca≈øt of life, <note place="margin">Luke 23.43:</note> or ≈øome ≈øhort time before he departed from the cro≈ø≈øe to paradi≈øe. An≈øwer. I confe≈ø≈øe that the ≈øcripture ≈øpeaketh of ≈øuch a one crucified at the right hand of the ≈øon of God, who crauing with faith mercy to ≈øaluation, receiued this an≈øwer, <hi>to day ≈øhalt thou be with me in paradi≈øe.</hi> Hee was called at the eleuenth houre at the poynt of the twelfe, when hee was now dying and drawing on; and therefore his conuer≈øion was altogether miraculous and extraordinary. And there was a ≈øpeciall rea≈øon why our Sauiour Chri≈øt would haue him to be then called; that while he was in ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he might ≈øhew forth the vertue of his pa≈ø≈øion, that all which ≈øaw the one, might al≈øo acknowledge the other. Now it is not good for any man to make an ordinary rule of an extraordinary example, and be≈øides the ≈øcripture ≈øpeakes but of one that was ≈øo ≈øaued; and it ≈øpeakes of another in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1365:81"/> that very place, and at that very in≈øtant that was damned. And herevpon a father ≈øaith, we reade of one, that no man ≈øhould de≈øpaire, and but of one, that no man ≈øhould pre≈øume. And vpon this al≈øo <hi>Origen</hi> writeth thus, there is no man hath cau≈øe to de≈øpaire of pardon, ≈øeeing Chri≈øt ≈øaid vnto the theefe <hi>verily this day thou ≈øhalt be with me in paradi≈øe,</hi> and yet may not too much pre≈øume of pardon, becau≈øe Chri≈øt ≈øaid not verely this day ≈øhall yee be with me in paradize.</p>
               <p>This example therefore is a medicine onely again≈øt de≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and no cloake for ≈øinne. And therefore let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member before we ≈øinne, that Chri≈øt pardoned not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and thereby feare his iu≈øtice; and after wee haue ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, let vs remember that Chri≈øt pardoned the theefe; and ≈øo hope for mercy. <hi>Et≈øi poenitentia e≈øt ≈øera, tamen indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia non e≈øt fera.</hi> Saith <hi>Lombard</hi> Gods mercy is aboue our mi≈øery, and an euening ≈øacrifice is accepted by him; &amp; yet on the other ≈øide we neuer reade that Chri≈øt cured one blind man often, that hee healed the ≈øame leapers diuers times, that he rai≈øed <hi>Lazarus</hi> twice. Marke well (≈øaith one) what I ≈øay, that a man which repenteth not but at his latter end ≈øhall be damned; I doe not ≈øay ≈øo, what then doe I ≈øay? He ≈øhall be ≈øaued? No. What then doe I ≈øay? I ≈øay I know not, I ≈øay I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume not, I promi≈øe not, will thou then deliuer thy ≈øelfe out of this doubt? Wilt thou e≈øcape this dangerous poynt?

One being demaunded when it was time to repent, an≈øwered, one day before our Death; but when it was replyed, that no man knew that day; he ≈øaid, begin then to day, for feare of fayling; and boa≈øt not of to morrow, for thou knowe≈øt not what a day may bring forth: many pretend to mend all in time, and this time is ≈øo deferred from day to day vntill God (in who≈øe hands one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

What? So ≈øoone and ≈øo yong? So ≈øaith the Scripture; and ≈øo it was without controuer≈øie. For Gods children take the good dayes of youth for good duties, and not the euill dayes of ≈øickly and ≈øaple≈ø≈øe old age, as commonly the children of the world doe. <hi>Samuel</hi> ≈øerued God in his minoritie, <note place="margin">1.

               <p>The rea≈øons why we mu≈øt thus begin to repent betimes, are the≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, repentance, as it can neuer come too ≈øoone, where ≈øinne is gone before, ≈øo it mu≈øt needs with much adoe, and not without ≈øome ≈øpeciall worke of God, ouertake ≈øo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ≈øinnes of youth and manhood, ≈øo farre, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, old age is full of wearine≈ø≈øe and trouble, and where we haue elbow-roome in youth, we cannot turne vs in old age; perhaps we ≈øhall neither heare, nor ≈øee, nor goe, nor ≈øit, without paine and torment in all parts; and is this (≈øay you) a fit condition of life, and time of age to ≈øerue God in. But ≈øay that the forcible working of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, like a great gale of winde, be able to blow thee home on the ≈øodaine, yet art thou not ≈øure to haue it. And doe≈øt thou thinke, ≈øeeing thou wilt not repent &amp; know God in youth, that hee will know thee at the≈øe yeeres, and in this ca≈øe and ≈øtate? And wilt thou be≈øtow on Satan the beautie, ≈øtrength and fre≈øhne≈ø≈øe of youth, &amp; offer to God the wrinkles, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and foule hew of old age? or when thou ha≈øt giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the flower of thy youth to Gods enemie, wilt thou of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1365:85"/> to God (who will haue the fir≈øt, and de≈øerues the be≈øt) the dregges and leauings? To all ≈øuch I ≈øay, if you will not know God in your youth, hee will neuer know thee, (for ought that thou knowe≈øt) when thou art gray-headed. If (as hath beene ≈øaid) thou wilt not giue him the yong and ≈øound, and that which is without blemi≈øh, he will neuer take in good part the old and ≈øicke, and euill fauoured, which no man will giue to his friend, nor dare offer to his prince. If thou wilt not, when thou art quick-witted, when thou art come to the yeares of dotage, he will not. If thou wilt not heare him in his day, thou ≈øhalt crie in thy day, that is, in the euill day, and ≈øhalt not bee heard. Yea God hath told thee (as we haue ≈øaid before) <hi>Becau≈øe I haue called and you refu≈øed, you ≈øhall call vpon me,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 1.24.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will not an≈øwere you.</hi> A dolefull and heauie doome for a dying man. It is too late to ≈øow, when thy fruite ≈øhould be in, and no time to leaue ≈øinne, when ≈øin mu≈øt leaue thee.</p>

                  <hi>Diues</hi> prayed, but was not heard. <hi>E≈øau</hi> wept, but was not pitied. The fooli≈øh Virgins knocked, but were denied. By which fearefull examples it appeareth, that it will be too late to call for mercie after this life, when the gates of mercie will be ≈øhut vp, and repentance comes too late. For if wee through our negligence and carele≈ø≈øene≈ø≈øe ouer≈ølip this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie, which the Lord in mercie offereth vs, we cannot recouer it afterward, although wee ≈øeeke it with teares; which we find truely verified by the fore-alledged fearefull examples. <note place="margin">E≈øay 59.2.</note> 
                  <hi>For your iniquities haue ≈øeperated betweene you and your God, and your ≈øinnes, haue hid his face from you, that hee will not heare.</hi> It is therefore the ≈øure≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt way, and better by many degrees, for the ≈øaluation of our ≈øoules, to leaue our ≈øinnes now in our youth, and now to repent in our health, then hereafter (alas!) when it may be too late.</p>
               <p>The holy Gho≈øt in the Scriptures pointeth vs to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent time and exhorteth vs to make that the time of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and vpon this Theme many of the holy men of God ≈øpent their Sermons.

                  <hi>Now turne vnto the Lord; now whiles it is called to day; to day if yee will heare his voice, this is the accepted time;</hi> and therefore wee may not come for it many yeeres hence, being promi≈øed to day.</p>
               <p>Iniquitie did then abound (as now it doth) and procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtination was euer dangerous, and therefore they iudged no doctrine ≈øo fitte, as often to vrge repentance without all delay.</p>
               <p>So that now euen now is the time of repentance, euen now whil≈øt he calleth, now while≈øt he ≈øpeaketh, now whil≈øt hee knocketh, now let vs take vp this day, and make it the ioyfull day of our repentance. <hi>For ioy ≈øhall be in heauen</hi> (≈øaith our Sauiour in the Go≈øpell) <note place="margin">Luke 15.7.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Now for conclu≈øion of this duetie of repentance, marke heere how happily we fall vpon repentance; God grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to fall vpon vs. It is a grace (when it fals vpon a ≈øinfull ≈øoule) that makes the Diuels murmure, <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> and vex them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in hell, and the good Angels reioyce in heauen.</p>
               <p>This is that which makes the eternall Wi≈ødome content to forget our iniquities, and to remember them no more, then if they had neuer beene; and this is <hi>Magna≈øpongia</hi> (as Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> calles it) the great ≈øpunge that wipes them all away out of the ≈øight of God: this ≈øpeakes to mercy to ≈øeperate our ≈øinnes from the face of God, to binde them vp in bundles, and drowne them in the ≈øea of obliuion: this is that mourning Ma≈øter, that is neuer without good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, teares of contrition, prayers for remi≈ø≈øion, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes of a mended life.

                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:1365:86"/> that di≈øchargeth all bonds of ≈øinne.

               <p>If you welcome repentance, knocking at your dore from God, it ≈øhall knocke at Gods doore of mercy for you. It askes of you amendment, of God forgiuene≈ø≈øe. Receiue it therefore and imbrace it.</p>
               <p>The fourth dutie is to die in prayer; for when it ≈øhall plea≈øe God in the weakne≈ø≈øe of our bodies, to giue vs a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our mortality and our end: let vs pray to God for grace, that we may ≈øpend the time of our ≈øickne≈ø≈øe in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods word and comfortable bookes, in godly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in holy meditation, and in feruent prayer to the Lord: fir≈øt for patience in thy ≈øickne≈ø≈øe: ≈øecondly, for comfort in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus: thirdly, for ≈øtrength in his mercy: and fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for deliuerance at his good plea≈øure; yea endeuour as much as thou can≈øt to die praying. For when thou art in the depthes of mi≈øeries, and at it were at the gates of death, there is a depth of Gods mercie, who is readie to heare and helpe thee: for mi≈øery mu≈øt call vpon mercie, and Prayer is the chiefe≈øt thing that a man may pre≈øent God withall. For by prayer we are oftentimes in ≈øpirit (with the ble≈ø≈øed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle) rapt vp into the third heauens, <note place="margin">2.

               <p>For the fir≈øt, Death is a priuation of life, as a puni≈øhment ordained of God, and impo≈øed on man for his ≈øinne. It is a priuation of life, becau≈øe the very nature of death is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence or defect of that life, which God vouch≈øafed man by his creation. I adde further, that death is a puni≈øhment, more e≈øpecially to intimate the nature and qualitie of death, and to ≈øhew that it was ordained as the meanes of the execution of Gods iudgement and iu≈øtice.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in euery puni≈øhment there bee three wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, the ordainer of it, the procurer, and the executioner.</p>
               <p>The ordainer of this puni≈øhment is God, in the e≈øtate of mans innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>cy, by a ≈øolemne law then made in the≈øe words. <hi>In the day that thou eate≈øt thereof,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.17.</note> 
                  <hi>thou ≈øhalt die the death.</hi> The Executioner of this puni≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t is al≈øo God him≈øelfe, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe te≈øtifieth in the Prophet <hi>E≈øay,</hi> in the≈øe words. <hi>I make
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1365:92"/> peace and create euill.</hi> And this is materiall or naturall euill, <note place="margin">E≈øay 45.7.</note> to the latter of which, Death is to be referred; which is the de≈øtruction and aboli≈øhment of mans nature created.</p>
               <p>The procurer of this puni≈øhment is not God, but man him≈øelfe, in that man by ≈øinne and di≈øobedience did put vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him≈øelfe this puni≈øhment. Therfore the Lord in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>O≈øea</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>O I≈ørael thou ha≈øt de≈øtroyed thy ≈øelfe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ho≈øea 13.9.</note> 
                  <hi>but in me is thy helpe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again≈øt this it may be obiected, that man was mortall in the e≈øtate of his innocencie before the fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øwere;</hi> The frame and compo≈øition of mans body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in it ≈øelfe, was mortall, becau≈øe it was made of water and earth, and other elements, which are of them≈øelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and changeable; yet if we re≈øpect the grace and ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing which God did vouch≈øafe mans bodie in his creation, it was vnchangeable and immortal, and ≈øo by the ≈øame ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing ≈øhould haue continued, if man had not fallen; and man by his fall, depriuing him≈øelfe of this gift, and the ble≈ø≈øing, became euery way mortall. And hereof it is that the Preacher ≈øaith, <hi>Loe this onely haue I found, that God made man vpright,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 7.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but they haue ≈øought out many inuentions.</hi> Againe, before the fall, mans bodie was but ≈øubiect to death, and could not then be ≈øaid to be dead, but after the fall, it was then not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øubiect to death, but might al≈øo be ≈øaid to bee dead. And therefore now in this re≈øpect the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Rom. 8.10</note> 
                  <hi>The body is dead becau≈øe of ≈øinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, mans bodie in his innocencie, was like vnto the bodie of Chri≈øt, when he was vpon the earth, that is, onely ≈øubiect vnto death, for he could not be ≈øaid to bee dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe in him there was no ≈øinne; and this was mans ca≈øe in his innocencie before his fall.</p>
               <p>Thus it appeares in part what death is. And yet for the better clearing of this point, wee are to con≈øider the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the death of a man, and a bea≈øt. The death of a bea≈øt is the totall and finall aboli≈øhment of the whole creature; for the body is re≈øolued to the fir≈øt matter, and the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1365:93"/> ≈øoule ri≈øing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the temperature of the body, is but a breath, and vani≈øheth to nothing. But in the death of a man it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe: For though the bodie for a time be re≈øolued and turned into du≈øt, out of which it came, yet it mu≈øt ri≈øe againe at the la≈øt day, and become immortall; but the ≈øoule ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øteth by it ≈øelfe out of the body, and is immortall. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of which difference is, for that the ≈øoule of man is a ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or ≈øpirituall ≈øub≈øtance, whereas the ≈øoule of a bea≈øt is no ≈øub≈øtance, but a naturall vigour or qualitie, and hath no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ≈øelfe without the body, on which it wholly depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. The ≈øoule of a man contrariwi≈øe, being created of nothing, <note place="margin">Gen. 2.7.</note> it is ≈øaid, <hi>God breathed into his no≈øtrils the breath of life,</hi> and then man became a liuing ≈øoule, and ≈øo as well ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting forth of it, as in it. But when God made the bea≈øts of the earth, he breathed not ≈øuch matter into them, but their bloud is as their ≈øoule, <note place="margin">Leuit. 17.14.</note> and their life; for the life of all fle≈øh is the bloud thereof. <note place="margin">P≈øal. 49.20.</note> So that, <hi>when bea≈øts die, they peri≈øh,</hi> as the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, <hi>and that is their end, and their ≈øpirit goeth downeward to the earth,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>but the ≈øpirit of man goeth vpward,</hi> ≈øaith the Preacher.</p>
               <p>Saint Ambro≈øe takes occa≈øion by this difference, &amp; from the ≈øhape of mans bodie, to aduerti≈øe our minde what our affections ≈øhould be. It is well ordained (≈øaith he) that man hath onely two feete with birds, and not foure feete with bea≈øts, for by this he may learne to flye aloft with the birds, and not with bea≈øtes encline and decline to the gro≈ø≈øer and earthly things of this world.</p>
               <p>Heere then we ≈øee, that ≈øince the fall of man, man is not: only ≈øubiect to death, but al≈øo may be ≈øaid a dead man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he ≈øhall as ≈øurely die, as if he were dead already, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as notwith≈øtanding he hath a forme and ≈øhew of immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Other things, ≈øo long as they retaine their forme, ≈øo long they doe remaine; A hou≈øe falleth not all the time that his forme and fa≈øhion la≈øteth; the brute bea≈øt dieth not, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he fir≈øt forgoe his life, which is his forme; but man hath a forme which neuer is di≈ø≈øolued, as namely, a minde
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1365:93"/> endued with rea≈øon, and yet he liueth now but a very ≈øhort time, in re≈øpect that his bodie, by rea≈øon of ≈øinne and di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, is become mortall, whereby man is the procuter of his owne death and puni≈øhment.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is a true ≈øaying of Saint <hi>Gregory,</hi> Man is the worke of God, ≈øinne is the worke of man; let vs therefore di≈øcerne what God hath made, and what man hath done; and neither for the error committed by man, let vs hate man, whom God made, nor for the man that is Gods worke, loue the ≈øinne that man hath committed. And againe here note we mu≈øt hate none in re≈øpect of his creation, but in re≈øpect he peruerteth the v≈øe of his creation, for they beare the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God which is louely, but they deface and ≈øcratch it out to their owne damnation; ≈øo that we mu≈øt hate not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but <hi>vitium,</hi> the wickedne≈ø≈øe of the man, and not the wicked as he is man.</p>
               <p>The kinds of death, as we haue heard in the fir≈øt Diui≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are three-fold; Naturall, Spirituall, Eternall, but they may be reduced into two only, as the kinds of life are, that is, bodily and ≈øpirituall. Bodily death is nothing el≈øe but the ≈øeparation of the ≈øoule from the body, as bodily life is the coniunction of body and ≈øoule. And this death is called the fir≈øt, becau≈øe in re≈øpect of time it goes before the ≈øecond. Spirituall death is the ≈øeparation of the whole man, both in bodie and ≈øoule, from the gratious and glorious fellow≈øhip of God. Of the≈øe two, the fir≈øt is but an entrance to death, and the ≈øecond is the accompli≈øhment of it: for as the ≈øoule is the life of the bodie, ≈øo God is the life of the ≈øoule, and his Spirit is the ≈øoule of our ≈øoules.</p>
               <p>Againe, this ≈øpirituall death hath three di≈øti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>ct and ≈øeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall degrees. The fir≈øt is, when it is aliue in re≈øpect of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, and yet it lies dead in ≈øinne. Of this degree the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeakes, when he ≈øaith, <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>Shee that liueth in plea≈øure is dead while ≈øhee liueth,</hi> and this is the e≈øtate of all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who are ≈øaid to be dead in ≈øinne.<note place="margin">Ephe≈ø. 2.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ≈øecond degree is in the very end of this life, when
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1365:94"/> the bodie is laid into the earth, then the ≈øoule de≈øcends into the place of torments, <note place="margin">Luk. 16.22.23.</note> as the ≈øoule of the rich man in the Go≈øpell.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the day of Iudgement, when the body and ≈øoule at the re≈øurrection of the la≈øt day meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe and ≈øhal goe to the place of the damned, there to bee tormented for euer. And this is called by the name of the ≈øecond death, <note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note> which doth belong onely to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate.</p>
               <p>Hauing thus found the nature, differences, and kinds of death, it is more then manife≈øt, that that place of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is to be vnder≈øtood, not of the ≈øpirituall death, but of the bodily death, becau≈øe it is oppo≈øed to the natiuitie and birth of man. The words then mu≈øt carry this ≈øence, The time of bodily death, in which there is a ≈øepara ion of the ≈øoule of man from the body, either naturall or violent (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called a bodily or worldly death) is better to the childe of God, then the time in which one is borne, and brought into the world.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the ≈øecond point; and that is, how this can bee true which the Preacher ≈øaith, <hi>That the day of ones death is better then the day of birth.</hi> I make not this que≈øtion to call the Scriptures into controuer≈øie, which are the truth it ≈øelfe, but I doe it to this end and purpo≈øe, that we might without doubting or wauering bee re≈øolued of the truth of this, which the Preacher heere auoucheth for the comfort of all the children of God at their death. For there may be ≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie rea≈øons brought to the contrary of this, which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher heere auoucheth.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs now handle the que≈øtions, rea≈øons, and obiections, which may be alledged to the contrary; which all may be reduced vnto ≈øixe heads.</p>
               <p>The fir≈øt is taken from the opinion of wi≈øe men, who thinke it the be≈øt thing of all neuer to bee borne. And the next, be≈øt to die quickly as ≈øoone as he is borne. For <hi>Cicero</hi> an Heathen man, and renowned for his eloquence and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1365:94"/> complaines that nature hath brought man forth into the world, not as a mother, but as a ≈øtepmother, with a body naked, weake and ≈øickly, and with a minde di≈øtracted with cares, deiected with feares, faint with labours, and addicted to lu≈øts and plea≈øures; And hence grew this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon ≈øpeech among≈øt the Gentiles related by <hi>Ari≈øtotle,</hi> repeated by <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and fathered vpon <hi>Sylemus,</hi> by all three, That the be≈øt thing in the world was, not to be borne at all, and the next, be≈øt to die ≈øoone≈øt. Now if it be the be≈øt thing in the world not to be borne at all, then it is the wor≈øt thing that can be, to die after a man is once borne. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> There be two ≈øorts of men, the one that liue and die in their fins; the other, that doe vnfainedly repent, and beleeue in Chri≈øt, the one goates, the other ≈øheepe, the one good, the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Now this ≈øentence and ≈øpeech of tho≈øe Heathen men may be truely applied &amp; auouched to the fir≈øt ≈øort, of whom we may ≈øay, as our Sauiour Chri≈øt ≈øaid of <hi>Iudas.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.24.</note> 
                  <hi>It had beene good for that man that he had neuer beene borne.</hi> But the ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied to the ≈øecond ≈øort, is mo≈øt fal≈øe. For to them that in this life turne to God by true and vnfained repentance, the be≈øt thing of all is to be borne, becau≈øe their birth is a degree of preparation vnto all ioy and happine≈ø≈øe, and the next be≈øt for them is to die quickly, becau≈øe by death they doe enter into the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and fruition of the ≈øame ioy and happine≈ø≈øe; for their birth is an entrance into it, and their death the accompli≈øhment of the ≈øame. And this was the cau≈øe that made <hi>Baalam</hi> ≈øo de≈øirous to die the death of the righteous, and to wi≈øh that his la≈øt end might be like theirs. <note place="margin">Num. 23.10.</note> And therefore in this re≈øpect the Preacher in this place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the day of death before the day of birth, vnder≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereby, that death which is ioyned, coupled, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a godly life; and this is called the death of the righteous.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond obiection is taken from the te≈øtimonies of the holy Scriptures, and namely the≈øe. <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20 1. Cor. 15.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Death</hi> (≈øaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle) <hi>is the wages of ≈øinne. Death is an enemie of Chri≈øt.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1365:95"/> Death is the cur≈øe of the Law.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3 13.</note> Hence it ≈øeemes to follow that in and by death men receiue their wages, and payment for their ≈øinnes; and ≈øo thereby the day of death is become the dolefull day, in which the enemie preuailes again≈øt vs, for that he which dieth is cur≈øed. <hi>An≈øw.</hi> We mu≈øt di≈øtingui≈øh heere of death: it mu≈øt be con≈øidered two wayes; fir≈øt, as it is in it ≈øelfe in his owne nature; ≈øecondly, as it is altered and changed by the death of Chri≈øt. Now death by it ≈øelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, is indeed the wages of ≈øinne, the enemie of Chri≈øt, and of all his members, and the cur≈øe of the law, yea the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ≈øuburbs and gates of hell, and ≈øo it is ≈øtill vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; yet in the ≈øecond re≈øpect it is not ≈øo; for by the vertue of the death of Chri≈øt it cea≈øeth to bee a plague or puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of a cur≈øe is made vnto vs a ble≈ø≈øing, and become vnto vs a friend, and a pa≈ø≈øage or middle way betweene this life and eternall life; and is become as it were a little wicket, entrance or doore, whereby we pa≈ø≈øe out of this world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen. And then in this re≈øpect this ≈øaying of the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher is mo≈øt true; for in the day of birth men are brought forth and borne into the vale of mi≈øery; but afterward when the children of God goe hence, hauing death altered vnto them by the death of Chri≈øt, they enter into eternall life and happine≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>The third obiection is taken from the example of mo≈øt worthy men, who (as it ≈øhould ≈øeeme) haue made their prayers again≈øt death, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> as our Sauiour Chri≈øt.</p>
               <p>We reade when our Sauiour Chri≈øt was borne, it was a ioyfull time; at who≈øe birth there was great ioy and mirth. <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 2.10.13.28.38. Luke 19.41. Marke 16.10. Luke 23.28.45 Matth. 27.51.</note> yea and the Angels of heauen did ≈øing, and they bid the Shepheards ≈øing, becau≈øe they brought them glad tidings of great ioy, which ≈øhould be vnto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But when our Sauiour Chri≈øt ≈øuffered death, then it ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that it was a dolefull time; for then there was as much lamentation and weeping. Our Sauiour Chri≈øt him≈øelfe wept (whom we reade to haue wept three times, at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of Ieru≈øalem, <note place="margin">Iohn 11.35.</note> at the rai≈øing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and in his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1365:95"/> agony) the di≈øciples wept, the daughters of Ieru≈øalem wept, <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> the Sunne was darkened, the vaile of the Temple was rent, the ≈øtones were clouen in ≈øunder. Yea all the≈øe and all ≈øence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe creatures in their kind did weepe and lament the death and pa≈ø≈øion of their maker. And ≈øo it ≈øhould ≈øeeme that our Sauiour Chri≈øt prayed again≈øt death on this manner, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 6.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Father if it be thy will, let this cup pa≈ø≈øe from me.</hi> Wee reade al≈øo that the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed again≈øt death, <hi>Returne O Lord</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>deliuer my ≈øoule, O ≈øaue me for thy mercies ≈øake; for in death there is no remembrance of thee, in the graue who ≈øhall giue thee thankes?</hi> Againe, <note place="margin">E≈øay 38.1.</note> wee reade that King <hi>Ezechiah</hi> prayed again≈øt death; for when the Prophet brought him word from the Lord, that hee ≈øhould die and not liue, this good king at this newes wept very ≈øore, and prayed for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life.</p>
               <p>Now by the examples of the≈øe mo≈øt worthy men, yea by the example of the Sonne of God him≈øelfe, it ≈øhould ≈øeeme that this ≈øhould not be true, which the Preacher doth heere auouch, That <hi>the day of death ≈øhould bee better then the day of birth,</hi> but rather that the day of death ≈øhould be the mo≈øt dolefull and terrible day of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> We are heere to vnder≈øtand, that when our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chri≈øt prayed in this ≈øort as we haue heard, he was in his agonie, and he then, as our Redeemer ≈øtood in our roome and ≈øtead, to ≈øuffer and endure all things, which wee our ≈øelues ≈øhould haue ≈øuffered in our own per≈øons for our ≈øins, if he him≈øelfe had not vouch≈øafed to ≈øuffer for vs: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee did not pray ≈øimply again≈øt the bodily or naturall death, but again≈øt the cur≈øed death of the Cro≈ø≈øe; for he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not death it ≈øelfe, which is the ≈øeparating of ≈øoule and bodie, but the cur≈øe of the Law which went with death, as namely, the vn≈øpeakeable wrath and iudgement of God, which was due for our ≈øinnes. The fir≈øt death troubled him not, but the fir≈øt and ≈øecond ioyned together. Therefore the Author to the Hebrewes ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chri≈øt in the daies of his fle≈øh, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1365:96"/> ≈øtrong crying and teares vnto him that was able to ≈øaue him from death, that he was heard in that he feared.</hi> By which place it appeareth, that Chri≈øt did not pray ≈øimply again≈øt the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, but again≈øt the cur≈øed death of the Cro≈ø≈øe, which was the ≈øecond death.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Dauids</hi> praying again≈øt death, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that when he made that ≈øixt P≈øalme, hee was not onely ≈øicke in bodie, but al≈øo perplexed with the greate≈øt temptation of all, in that hee wra≈øtled in con≈øcience again≈øt the wrath of God, as appeares by his owne words.

                  <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy anger, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein wee may ≈øee that he prayed not ≈øimply again≈øt death, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt death at that in≈øtant, when hee was in that grieuous temptation, for at other times he had no ≈øuch feare of death. And therefore in another P≈øalme he ≈øaith, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 23.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yea though I walke through the valley of the ≈øhadow of death, I wil feare none ill, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore he prayed again≈øt death onely in that ≈øixt P≈øalm, as it was ioyned with apprehen≈øion of Gods wrath, as our Sauiour Chri≈øt did.</p>
               <p>La≈øtly, touching king <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> wee are to vnder≈øtand that he prayed again≈øt death, not onely becau≈øe hee de≈øired to liue, and to doe ≈øeruice to God in his kingdome, but al≈øo it was vpon a further and more ≈øpecial regard, becau≈øe when the Prophet brought him this me≈ø≈øage of death he was then without i≈ø≈øue, hauing none of his owne body to ≈øucceede him in his kingdome.</p>
               <p>But then it wil be obiected, What warrant he had to pray again≈øt death for this cau≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> His warrant was good; for God had made a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular promi≈øe vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> and his po≈øteritie after him, <note place="margin">1. King. 2.4.</note> that as long as they feared him, and walked in his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all their heart, and with all their ≈øoule, there ≈øhal not faile thee (≈øaith he) a man on the throne of I≈ørael. Now this good king <hi>Hezekiah</hi> at the time of the Prophets me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage of death, remembring what promi≈øe God had made to <hi>Dauid</hi> and to his ≈øeed, and how that he for his part in ≈øome
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1365:96"/> poore and weake mea≈øure had kept the condition, in that he had walked before God with an vpright heart, and had done that which was well plea≈øing and acceptable in his ≈øight, as he him≈øelfe ≈øaith in the ≈øame place; <note place="margin">I≈øay 38 3.</note> therefore hee prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt death, not for that he feared it, but he de≈øired to haue i≈ø≈øue of his own to ≈øucceed him according to the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe to his ≈øeruant <hi>Dauid.</hi> Which prayer of his was ≈øo well accepted of God, that hee gaue him his reque≈øt, and added vnto his daies fifteene yeeres; and three yeeres after God gaue him <hi>Mana≈ø≈øes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I≈øay 38.5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, be≈øide the≈øe examples it will be further obiected, that the godly haue feared death, <note place="margin">1. Kings 19.30.</note> or e≈ø≈øe why did <hi>Eliah</hi> flie from it in the per≈øecution of <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and Chri≈øt teach his to flie it in the per≈øecutions of men: <note place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> and Chri≈øt him≈øelfe (as we haue alreadie heard) did pray again≈øt the bitter cup of it in his agonie, <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> and before his apprehen≈øion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Tho≈øe Saints did not, nor were to flie from death as it is the end of life, and a mo≈øt ble≈ø≈øed end of a good life, but v≈øed the meanes of flight onely to preuent violent and ha≈øtie death till the houre appointed ≈øhould come, that they were to giue their ≈øpirit in peace into the hands of him that made it; and becau≈øe ≈øuch vntimely death was enemy to the good they had to doe, and cour≈øe they were to fini≈øh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went a≈øide by flying for ≈øome time, and till the time of their departure come, that they might doe the good to which they were appointed, and fini≈øh the cour≈øe for which they were ≈øent. For if a remouing or flying for thine ea≈øe in this re≈øpect may be effected by ≈øhifting thy place, that may both be de≈øired and v≈øed without ≈øinne. <hi>I≈øaak</hi> ≈øent his ≈øonne <hi>Iacob</hi> away from his brother <hi>E≈øau.</hi> when <hi>E≈øau</hi> in his anger, had ≈øworne to ≈ølay him: <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from the hand and iauelin of <hi>Saul,</hi> and ≈øhifted for him≈øelfe by remouing from place to place, and conuayed all his fathers hou≈øe into the land of Moab from <hi>Sauls</hi> reach. The Lord Ie≈øus often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times withdrew him≈øelfe from the rage of the Iewes, and he gaue his Di≈øciples a rule for times of per≈øecution, ≈øaying,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1365:97"/> 
                  <hi>When they per≈øecute you in this city,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 10.23.</note> 
                  <hi>flie into another.</hi> And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hone≈øt men haue remooued their habitations to auoide euill neighbours, and free them≈øelues from beeing troubled by hem.</p>
               <p>But where it is againe alledged that Chri≈øt him≈øelfe prayed again≈øt the cup of death; for the further ≈øatisfying of this point, I an≈øwere further two wayes: Fir≈øt, that hee prayed without ≈øinne again≈øt it, ≈øeeing that in his ≈øupplication of teares, and much feare hee ≈øubmitted to his Fathers will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. <note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.42.</note> 
                  <hi>Neuerthele≈ø≈øe</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And againe, <hi>O my Father, if this cup may not pa≈ø≈øe away from me, except I drinke it, thy will be done.</hi> Al≈øo death was not to him as it is to vs; for to vs the ≈øting of it is conquered, and the force broken, but to him it was in full power, he felt the ≈øting of it, and wra≈øtled with the force of it in ≈øoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Secondly I ≈øay (as was ≈øaid before) that it was not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bodily death (though vn≈øubdued, ≈øaue where him≈øelfe ≈øubdued it) that he trembled at, but by the burthen of our ≈øinnes, which he was to vndergoe, in which hee beheld the whole. There he ≈øaw his Fathers countenance turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, and there knew that he mu≈øt beare his wrath, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he bare our ≈øinnes. And be≈øides, Chri≈øt feared death, beeing cloathed with our fle≈øh, to ≈øhew that he tooke our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, <note place="margin">I≈øay. 53.4,5,6.</note> and bore our ≈øorrowes, and was perfect man.</p>
               <p>And ≈øo death may in ≈øome ca≈øe be feared, and at ≈øometime prayed again≈øt; but euer vnder the correction of Gods will. For the rod of death turned into a ≈øerpent, made <hi>Moi≈øes</hi> feare; <note place="margin">Exod. 4.3.</note> and the be≈øt haue moderately declined and ≈øhrunke at the ≈øtroke of death, when it came in ≈øome tempe≈øt; and who doth not dread all Gods terrors, whereof death is one, and feare that which is the puni≈øhment of ≈øinne, and cur≈øe of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and decline that, which is the ruine and de≈øtruction of humane nature, and ≈øhrinke at that which hath made the ≈øtronge≈øt, the wi≈øe≈øt, the greate≈øt, the riche≈øt to fall downe flat before it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the feare of death thus reproued, is not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1365:97"/> feare of it, which is in all, but the ≈øeruile feare of it proper to euill doers, and common to tho≈øe who can haue no hope in death, becau≈øe they neuer cared to liue, till they were compelled to die.</p>
               <p>The fourth obiection is, that tho≈øe who haue beene repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of the better ≈øort of men, haue oftentimes mi≈øera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ends; for ≈øome end their dayes de≈øpayring, ≈øome rauing and bla≈øpheming, ≈øome ≈øtrangely tormented. It may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øeeme that the day of death is the day of greate≈øt woe and mi≈øerie.</p>
               <p>To this I an≈øwer fir≈øt of all generally, that wee mu≈øt not iudge of the e≈øtate of any man before God by outward things, whether they be ble≈ø≈øings or iudgements, whether they fall in life or in death. For as the Preacher ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 9.1.2.</note> 
                  <hi>No man knoweth either loue or hatred by all things that are before them; all things come alike to all, and the ≈øame condition is to the iu≈øt and to the wicked, and to the good and pure, and to the polluted, and to him that ≈øacrificeth, and to him that ≈øacrificeth not; as is the good, ≈øo is the ≈øinner; he that ≈øweareth, as he that feareth an oath.</hi> Againe the Preacher ≈øaith, <note place="margin">Eccle≈ø. 8.14.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a vanity that is done vpon the earth, that there be iu≈øt men to whom it hapneth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the work of the wicked, and there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the worke of the righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I an≈øwere to the particulars which be alleaged, in this manner; Fir≈øt for de≈øpaire: it is true, that not onely wicked and loo≈øe per≈øons de≈øpaire in death, but al≈øo godly and penitent ≈øinners, who often in their ≈øickne≈ø≈øe te≈øtifie of them≈øelues, that beeing aliue and lying in their beds, they feele them≈øelues to bee as it were in hell, and to apprehend the very pangs and torments of it; and I doubt not for all this, but that the child of God which is mo≈øt deare vnto him, may through the gulfe of de≈øperation attaine to euerla≈øting life and happine≈ø≈øe. Which appeares to bee ≈øo by Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the matter of our ≈øaluation: For all the workes of God are done in and by their contraries. In the creation all things were made not of ≈øomething, but of nothing, cleane
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1365:98"/> contrary to the cour≈øe of nature: In the worke of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion God giues life not by life, but by death. And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider aright of Chri≈øt vpon the Cro≈ø≈øe, wee ≈øhall ≈øee our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radi≈øe out of paradi≈øe, in the mid≈øt of hell; for out of his own cur≈øed death, hee brings vs a ble≈ø≈øed life, and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈ø≈øe. Likewi≈øe in our effectuall vocation, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth God to conuert and turne men vnto him, he doth it by the meanes of the preaching of the Go≈øpel, which in rea≈øon ≈øhould driue men from God, for it is as contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, as fire to water, and light to darkne≈ø≈øe. For the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.21.22.23.52.</note> 
                  <hi>After that in the wi≈ødome of God, the world by wi≈øedome knew not God, it plea≈øed God by the fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe of preaching to ≈øaue them that beleeue. For the Iewes require a ≈øigne, and the Greekes ≈øeeke after wi≈ødome; but we preach Chri≈øt crucified, vnto the Iewes a ≈øtumbling block, and vnto the Greekes fooli≈øhne≈ø≈øe.</hi> And yet for all this, though it be thus again≈øt the nature and di≈øpo≈øition of man, it preuailes with him at length, and turnes him vnto his God, it hee belong vnto him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, when God will ≈øend his owne ≈øeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, he ≈øends ≈øome of them a contrary way, euen as it were by the gates of hell. For our way to heauen is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øe, euen as the Lord led the I≈øraelites out of Egypt into the Land of Canaan, not through the Land of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtims, <note place="margin">Exod. 13.17.18</note> although that were neere, <hi>For God ≈øiad le≈øt peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the people repent, when they ≈øee warre, and returne to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> but God led the people about thorow the way of the wilderne≈ø≈øe of the red ≈øea. So God for many cau≈øes be≈øt knowne to him≈øelfe, doth bring his children out of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian world vnto the ≈øpiriutall Canaan, which is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen; not the neere≈øt way, but by many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and turnings, and the furthe≈øt way about, euen as it were thorow the red ≈øea of mi≈øeries and afflictions, that all Gods waues and billowes may goe ouer them.<note place="margin">P≈øal. 42.7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord can (if he plea≈øe) bring them, as he doth many other of his children, the neere≈øt way to heauen, but this
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1365:98"/> further way about is for Gods owne glorie, and for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens owne good. And God as a mo≈øt wi≈øe Father, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ki≈ø≈øing his childe, but many times correcting him: and the ≈øame God that doth mercifully exalt vs, by giuing vs a ≈øweete ta≈øte, and liuely feeling of his grace, and the efficacie of it in vs, doth in much loue many times for our health humble vs, when hee leaues vs without that ≈øence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our ≈øelues, and then doth he cure vs of the mo≈øt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous di≈øea≈øe of pride, and confidence in our ≈øelues, ≈øettle in vs a true foundation of humilitie, cau≈øe vs to deny our ≈øelues and depend wholly vpon him, to ca≈øt our ≈øelues into the armes of his mercie, to hunger for his grace, to pray more zealou≈øly and with greater feeling of our wants, and to ≈øet an high price vpon the ≈øence of Gods fauour, to make more e≈øteeme of it when we haue it againe, and to kill and mortifie ≈øome ≈øpecial ≈øinne, for which before we had not ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou≈øly and heartily repented. For when it is his good will and plea≈øure to make men depend on his fauour and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hee maketh them fir≈øt to feele his anger and di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, and to be nothing in them≈øelues, to the end they might value and prize their vocation and calling at an higher rate and e≈øtimate, and wholly and altogether rely and depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and be what≈øoeuer they are, in him only.</p>
               <p>This point being then well weighed and con≈øidered, it is more then manife≈øt, that the child of God may pa≈ø≈øe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euen thorow the very depth and gulfe of hell. For the loue, fauour, and mercie of God is like to a ≈øea, into which, when a man is ca≈øt, he neither feeles bottom, nor ≈øees banke: <hi>For thy mercy</hi> (≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt) <hi>is great aboue the heauens,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P≈øal. 108.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy truth reacheth vnto the clouds.</hi> So that touching de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpaire, whether it ari≈øeth of the weakne≈ø≈øe of nature, or of the con≈øcience of ≈øinne, though it fall out about the time of death, it can be but the voice and opinion of their ≈øickne≈ø≈øe; and a ≈øicke-mans iudgement of him≈øelfe, at ≈øuch time, is not to be regarded; and be≈øides, it cannot preiudize the ≈øaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ≈øoules, that are effectually called: <hi>For the gifts
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1365:99"/> and calling of God</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>are without repentance;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.29.</note> and tho≈øe whom God loueth, hee loueth to the end, and world without end. And as for other ≈øtrange euents which fall out in death, they are the effects of di≈øea≈øes. Rauings, bla≈øphemies and idle ≈øpeeches ari≈øe of the di≈øea≈øe of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and phren≈øies, which often happen at the end of hot burning feauers, the choler ≈øhooting vp to the braine; the writhing of the lips, turning of the necke, and buckling of the ioynts and the whole body, proceed of crampes and convul≈øions, which follow after much euacuation; and whereas ≈øome in ≈øickne≈ø≈øe are of that ≈øtrength, that three or foure can hardly hold them without bonds; it comes not alwayes of witchcraft, as people commonly thinke, but of choler in the veines; and whereas ≈øome when they are dead, become as blacke as pitch, it may ri≈øe by a brui≈øe or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtume, or by the blacke Iaundi≈øe, or the putrefaction of the liuer, and doth not alwayes argue ≈øome extraordinary iudgement of God; in the wicked it doth, but in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not.</p>
               <p>Now the≈øe and the like di≈øea≈øes with their ≈øymptomes, and ≈øtrange effects, though they doe depriue man of his health, and of the right v≈øe of the parts of his bodie, and the v≈øe of rea≈øon and vnder≈øtanding, yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue his ≈øoule of eternal life and happine≈ø≈øe, which with the ≈øoule of <hi>Dauid</hi> is bound vp in the bundle of life, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.29.</note> with the Lord his God in eternall peace and ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe. And all ≈øins procured by the≈øe violent and ≈øharpe di≈øea≈øes, proceeding from repentant ≈øinners, are ≈øins only of infirmity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, for which if they knew them, and came againe to the v≈øe of rea≈øon and vnder≈øtanding, they will further repent, if not, yet they are pardoned and buried in the bloud of Chri≈øt, and in his death, who is their Sauiour and great Bi≈øhoppe of their ≈øoules; <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.24.25.</note> for he that forgiueth the greater ≈øinnes, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo in his children forgiue the le≈ø≈øe. And againe, wee ought not to ≈øtand ≈øo much vpon the ≈øtrangene≈ø≈øe of any mans end, when we knew before the goodne≈ø≈øe of his conuer≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1365:99"/> and life. For wee mu≈øt iudge a man in this ca≈øe, not by his vnquiet death, but by his former quiet godly life.</p>
               <p>And if this bee true that ≈øtrange di≈øea≈øes, and thereupon very ≈øtrange behauiour in death may befall the be≈øt childe of God, we mu≈øt then learne to reforme our iudgements of ≈øuch as lye thus at the point of death.</p>
               <p>The common opinion is, if a man lye quietly in his ≈øick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and goe away like a lambe (which in ≈øome di≈øea≈øes, as in con≈øumptions and ≈øuch like lingring di≈øea≈øes, any man may doe) that then he goes ≈øtraight-way to heauen, though he haue liued neuer ≈øo wickedly. But if the violence of the di≈øea≈øe ≈øtirre vp impatiencie, and cau≈øe in the partie frantick and vn≈øeemely behauiour, then men v≈øe to ≈øay, though hee be neuer ≈øo godly, that there is a iudgement of God, ≈øeruing either to di≈øcouer an Hypocrite, or to plague a wicked man. But the truth is farre otherwi≈øe, for in truth one may die like a lambe, and yet goe to hell. For the P≈øalmi≈øt ≈øaith, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 7 3.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>There are no bonds in their death, but their ≈øtrength is firme, they are not in trouble as other men, neither are they plagued as other men.</hi> And againe, another dying in exceeding torments and ≈øtrange behauiour of the body, may goe to heauen; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples whereof we haue in that holy and iu≈øt man <hi>Iob,</hi> as may appeare throughout his whole booke; and in diuers others Gods deare Saints and children. Therefore by the≈øe ≈øtrange and violent kinds of ≈øickne≈ø≈øe and death, which doe many times happen to the deare Saints of God: wee mu≈øt take great heed that wee iudge not ra≈øhly of them in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to be wicked and notorious Hypocrites and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; for it may be our owne cafe for ought wee know. This ra≈øh cen≈øuring and iudging, was the ≈øinne of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Barbarians, as we may reade in the Acts of the Apo≈øtles. <note place="margin">Act. 28.3 4.5.6</note> This ra≈øh cen≈øuring and iudging, was al≈øo the ≈øinne of the wicked Iewes, as we may reade in the Go≈øpell of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Luke 13.1.2.3.4.5.</note> wherein they did vtter a ≈øecret corruption, naturally ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all men, that is, very ≈øharpely to ≈øee into the ≈øinnes of others, and ≈øeuerely to cen≈øure them; but in the meane

               <p>Now all the≈øe obiections being thus an≈øwered at large, it doth appeare plainly to be a manife≈øt truth, which the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher here ≈øaith, <hi>That the day of death is better then the day of ones birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I come to the third point, in which the rea≈øons and re≈øpects are to be con≈øidered, that make the day of death to ≈øurpa≈ø≈øe the day of ones birth; and they may all be reduced to this one, namely, that the birth day is an entrance into all woe and mi≈øerie; whereas the day of death ioyned and accompanied with a godly and reformed life, is an entrance and degree to eternall life and glory. Which appeareth thus: <hi>viz.</hi> Eternall life hath three degrees; one in this life, and that is, when a man can truly ≈øay with the Apo≈øtle, <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> 
                  <hi>I am cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chri≈øt, neuerthele≈ø≈øe I liue; yet not I, but Chri≈øt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in mee.</hi> And this all ≈øuch can ≈øay, as truely repent and beleeue, and that are iu≈øtified, ≈øanctified, and haue the peace of a good con≈øcience, and are furni≈øhed with the giftes and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1365:102"/> graces of Gods holy Spirit, which is the earne≈øt of their ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>The ≈øecond degree is in the end of this life, when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die goes to the earth from whence it came, and the ≈øoule returnes to God that gaue it.</p>
               <p>The third degree is in the end of this world at the la≈øt iudgement, when bodie and ≈øoule being re-vnited, do ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Now of the≈øe three degrees, death it ≈øelfe (being coupled with the feare of God) is the ≈øecond, in as much as death is as it were the hand of God, to ≈øort and ≈øingle out all tho≈øe that are the ≈øeruants of God, from among≈øt the wicked of this wretched world. So that death is a freedome from all mi≈øeries, which haue their end in death; and which is the fir≈øt benefit that comes by death, and the fir≈øt ≈øtep to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life and glory. And the ≈øecond benefit that comes by death, is, that it giues an entrance to the ≈øoule, and makes way for it, and doth (as it were) v≈øher it into the glorious pre≈øence of the euerla≈øting God, of Chri≈øt, of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the re≈øt of Gods Saints in heauen. And this is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table comfort again≈øt death; for as all other euils of paine, are to a godly Chri≈øtian changed into another nature, and of puni≈øhments are become fauours, and benefits; ≈øo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo in this of death; for now it is not a token of Gods wrath for ≈øinne, but an argument of his loue, mercie, and fauour to his children. It is not properly death, but as it were a bridge by which we pa≈ø≈øe to a better life; from corruption to incorruption, from mortalitie to immortalitie, from earth to heauen; that is in a word, from vanity and mi≈øerie, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy and felicitie, and a way thereby made for the re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Now who would not willingly pa≈ø≈øe ouer this bridge that is ≈øo ea≈øie, whereby he goeth from all cares and ≈øorrowes, to all delight and plea≈øure, leauing all mi≈øeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and hauing all contentation and happine≈ø≈øe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>The gentiles taking it for granted, that either after death
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1365:102"/> we ≈øhould be happie, or not be at all, concluded that at lea≈øt death would free vs from all euill and mi≈øerie, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did willingly embrace death, as a rich trea≈øure. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians al≈øo builded gorgeous Sepulchres, but meane hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, becau≈øe the one was to them but an Inne, the other, as they did thinke, an eternall habitation, which freed them from all mi≈øery. And <hi>Seneca</hi> again exclaimes, that our whole life is a penance, which the <hi>Thracians</hi> confirmed by their practi≈øe, celebrating their childrens birth with weeping and lamentation, but their death with great ioy and mirth, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ancient Writers record; whereby in≈øinuating, that our life is nothing but mi≈øerie, and death the end of mi≈øerie. But they haue beene all greatly mi≈øtaken therin, for it is the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chri≈øtian only which enioyeth the≈øe benefits by death, as namely the exemption and freedome from all cares, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and mi≈øeries.

               <p>By beds, the Scripture vnder≈øtandeth the places, where the Lord be≈øtoweth the bodies of his ≈øeruants after their death, whether fire or water, or the paunches of wild bea≈øts, or the chambers of the earth, ≈øea, or ayre; and the≈øe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led beds, becau≈øe they ≈øhall re≈øt quietly in them, as in their beds, till the morning bell, or loud trumpet of the la≈øt great day, warning all fle≈øh to ri≈øe, ≈øhall rai≈øe them. And therefore it is ≈øuch an v≈øuall thing in the Scriptures, ≈øo ≈øoone as men dye to ≈øay they fall a≈øleep, becau≈øe therby is meant that they are laid in their beds of peace; and they are called beds of re≈øt, to put difference betweene the≈øe beds of our nights ≈øleepe and tho≈øe of our ≈øleepe in death: for heere be our beds neuer ≈øo ≈øoft or well made, we often take no re≈øt, by rea≈øon of ≈øome di≈øtemper in our bodies, or fancies in our head; but in the≈øe ≈øleeping places, <note place="margin">P≈øal. 4.8.</note> which are called beds of re≈øt, wee may <hi>lay vs downe</hi> (≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt) <hi>and ≈øleepe in peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the Lord our life being our keeper, will make vs dwell in ≈øafetie.</hi>

               <p>Indeed in it owne nature, the graue is rather an hou≈øe of perdition, then a bed of re≈øt; but being altered to the Iewes in promi≈øe, to vs in performance, by Chri≈øts graue, who was buried in the earth, to change the nature of it, it is made to vs a chamber of re≈øt, and bed of downe.</p>
               <p>The≈øe titles which are thus giuen vnto death, is a ≈øweete comfort to the children of God again≈øt the terrors of death, for the graues of the righteous, which by nature are the hou≈øes of de≈øtruction, and chambers of feare, are by Chri≈øt and the graue of Chri≈øt made vnto them chambers of ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and beds of re≈øt. Chri≈øt by his buriall hath con≈øecrated
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1365:103"/> and perfumed our graues, making them which were pri≈øons to hell, gates to heauen. At night we take our chambers, and lye downe in our beds, ≈øo when death comes (which is the end of life, as the night is of the day) we goe to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the earth, and there lye downe in our beds, till the day of refre≈øhing (which is the day of ri≈øing) come, that commeth from the Lord.</p>
               <p>This is a confutation of that phan≈øie, that hath ≈øo long deluded the ≈øimple world, which is, that dead bodies walke after their death, and appeare vnto men. For how can that be, when the bodies of Gods children re≈øt in their beds, ≈øo ≈øoone as the breath departeth, and the bodies of the wicked are in their pri≈øons, till the day of a≈ø≈øi≈øe. Whereof, if any make a que≈øtion, let him open their graues, and ≈øee. And ≈øeeing the ≈øoule returneth not, after it hath left the body, how can the body walke that wanteth a ≈øoule, or the ≈øoule be ≈øeene, if it ≈øhould walke, which hath no bodie? <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> or if death be a loo≈øing of our ≈øoules from our bodies, how can there be any death, when ≈øoule and body are not parted, and when the man is not dead, but liueth.</p>
               <p>But this phan≈øie came from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and is but a Philo≈øophers dreame, told by him to the world, which was that the ≈øoules of men departed, did enter into the bodies of other men, good ≈øoules into good, and bad into bad mens bodies.

So entred the error, that ≈øpirits did walke, and that dead bodies came out of their graues, and haunted ≈øundry hou≈øes in the night, which were not the bodies of the dead, but the Diuell in tho≈øe bodies or ≈øhapes, as it is to be ≈øeene in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> counterfeit ≈øhape, rai≈øed by the Witch at Endor. <note place="margin">1.

But the e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drift of the holy Gho≈øt in the holy Scripture, by entitling death by the names of bed, of peace, of re≈øt, of ≈øleepe and ≈øuch like (being all names of ≈øinguler commoditie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit) is for the ≈øinguler comfort of all Gods children, ≈øignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto them thereby, that they ≈øhal feele no bitterne≈ø≈øe in death, but rather ioy, and reioyce in their deliue ance, as if they were going to their beds, and their liues are not lo≈øt, but their bodies ≈øleepe, as in a bed, mo≈øt ≈øweetely, vntill the re≈øurrection.</p>
               <p>How ≈øweete is peace to them which haue bin long trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with warres and tedious contentions; how plea≈øant is the bed, re≈øt and ≈øleepe, to them that haue ouerwatched them≈øelues. The Laborer is glad when his taske is done, the traueller reioyceth when he commeth to the end of his iourney, the Mariner is happie, when after a dangerous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age he arriueth in his harbour.

And though the bodie rotte in the graue, or bee eaten of wormes, or deuoured by bea≈øts or ≈øwallowed vp by fi≈øhes, or burnt to a≈øhes, yet that will not be to vs a matter of di≈øcomfort, not-onely becau≈øe (as wee haue heard before) they are at re≈øt and doe ≈øleepe in peace in their beddes till the la≈øt day, but al≈øo (if wee doe well con≈øider the ground of all grace) as namely our vnion and coniunction with Chri≈øt our head) it is indeede a ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and yet mo≈øt real coniunction and vnion. For we mu≈øt not imagine that our ≈øoules alone are ioyned and vnited to the body or ≈øoule of Chri≈øt, but the whole par≈øon of man both body and ≈øoule, is vnited and conioyned to whole Chri≈øt. For we are vnited wholy to whole Chri≈øt (who is not deuided) euen according to both natures, <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.13. 1. Cor.3.21.</note> by which hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1365:105"/> is wholy oure; but after this good order, as fir≈øt to be vnited to the manhood, and then by the manhood vnto the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chri≈øt. And when we are once ioyned and vnited to whole Chri≈øt in this mortall life by the bond of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we ≈øhal ≈øo abide and remaine eternally ioyned and vnited vnto him. And this coniunction and vnion being once tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, can never afterward be di≈ø≈øolued.</p>
               <p>Hence it followes that although the bodie bee ≈øeuered from the ≈øoule by death, yet neither the ≈øoule nor body are ≈øeuered or ≈øundred from Chri≈øt, but the very bodie rotting in the graue, or how≈øoeuer el≈øe con≈øumed, abide ≈øtill ioyned and vnited vnto Chri≈øt, and is then as truly a member of Chri≈øt, as it was before death. For looke what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Chri≈øt in death, the ≈øame or the like is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his members. Now the condition of Chri≈øt was this; though his body and ≈øoule were ≈øeuered and ≈øundered for the time the one from the other, as farre as heauen and the graue, yet neither of them were ≈øundered from the God-head of the Sonne, but both did in his Death ≈øub≈øi≈øt in his per≈øon. Euen ≈øo though our bodies and ≈øoules bee pulled in ≈øunder by naturall or violent death, yet neither of them, no not the body it ≈øelfe ≈øhalbe pulled or di≈øioyned from Chri≈øt the head; but by the vertue of this coniunction and vnion ≈øhall the dead body (how≈øoeuer it bee wa≈øted and con≈øumed) ari≈øe at the la≈øt day to eternall glory. For although the dead bodies of Gods Saints are often mingled with the bodies of bea≈øts, foules, fi≈øhes or other creatures that deuoure them; yet as the Gold≈ømith by his art can feuer mettals, and extract one met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall out of another: euen ≈øo God can and will di≈øtingui≈øh the≈øe du≈øts of his Saints at the la≈øt day of the glorious re≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

For the bodies of Gods elect being the members of Chri≈øt, though they be neuer ≈øo much rotten, putrified and con≈øumed, yet are they ≈øtill in Gods fauour, and in the couenant of grace, to which, becau≈øe they haue right, being dead, they ≈øhall not remaine ≈øo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in their graues, but ≈øhall ari≈øe againe at the la≈øt day vnto glory. And by rea≈øon of this vnion and coniunction with Chri≈øt, we gaine the prayers of the Saints yet liuing with vs, the loue of the Saints glorified before vs, the mini≈øtrie of Angels working for vs, grace in earth, and glory in heauen. And in Chri≈øt, our gaine is ≈øuch, as that we ≈øhall haue all lo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes recompenced, all wants ≈øupplied, all cur≈øes remoued, all cro≈ø≈øes ≈øanctified, all graces increa≈øed, all hopes confirmed, all promi≈øes performed, all ble≈ø≈øedne≈ø≈øe procured, Satan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, death de≈øtroyed, the graue ≈øweetened, corruption aboli≈øhed, ≈øanctification perfected, and heauen opened for our happy entrance. And as for death it ≈øelfe, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider, that it is chiefely ≈øinne that makes it ≈øo terrible vnto vs; for in it ≈øelfe, and by it ≈øelfe, it is the wages of ≈øinne, and the reuenging ≈øcourge of the angry God, but vnto tho≈øe that beleeue in Chri≈øt, it is changed into a mo≈øt ≈øweete ≈øleepe. For although the regenerate, &amp; tho≈øe that beleeue in Chri≈øt, doe as yet carry about the reliques of ≈øinne in their fle≈øh, from whence al≈øo the bodie is dead, that is to ≈øay, ≈øubiect to

Therefore by death the true and ≈øpiritual life of the ≈øoule doth not die in them, but doth rather begin; to which death is con≈øtrained to doe (as it were) the office of a midwife. So that now we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from ≈øinne, in Chri≈øt, that it cannot hurt vs, nay it is conuerted to our owne profit; and therfore death hauing her ≈øtrength from ≈øinne, is not to bee feared, ≈øith ≈øinne, the ≈øting of death, is ouercome. What need wee feare the ≈ønake that hath lo≈øt her ≈øting, ≈øhee can only hi≈ø≈øe and make a noy≈øe, but cannot hurt; and therefore wee ≈øee that many hauing taken out the ≈øting, will carry the ≈ønake in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomes without any feare.

               <p>Which will be the more manife≈øt, if we well weigh how Chri≈øt our head and Captaine hath quelled and conquered this mightie Gyant for vs, whereby none that are Chri≈øts members need ≈øtand in feare thereof. <hi>Death</hi> (≈øaith the ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed Apo≈øtle) <hi>is ≈øwallowed vp in victory,</hi> and Chri≈øt was dead, and now liueth, <note place="margin">1.

For although, becau≈øe he was man, he could die, and did ≈øo, yet becau≈øe he was iu≈øt, hee ought not to haue died; and hee that had no cau≈øe to die for him≈øelfe, in rea≈øon and equitie ≈øhould not die for others vnprofitably,; neither did he ≈øurely, but to the greate≈øt purpo≈øe, that the Sonne of God dying for the ≈øonnes of men, the ≈øonnes of men might thereby bee made the ≈øonnes of God; yea that they of bad ≈øeruants, might bee made good ≈øonnes.

               <p>It is ≈øufficient to waigh the≈øe matters with the waights of the Lords Sanctuarie, and not needfull to try them by fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching helpes of humane rea≈øon.

               <p>And touching this matter which now is mooued, I haue read, and you may ≈øee what Heathens by learning and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, haue ≈øaid to them≈øelues and their friends in ≈øuch lo≈ø≈øes; but this did I neuer read, neither ≈øhall you finde, that all their comforts haue counteruailed one promi≈øe out of Gods booke. I confe≈ø≈øe the bookes of heathen Writers doe promi≈øe comfort in this ca≈øe, but (alas) they performe it not:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1365:119"/> but are like a brooke that ≈øwels in winter when there is no need of it, and is dry in Summer when the pa≈ø≈øenger fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and panteth for heat: no, if we will haue good gold, we mu≈øt goe to Ophir: if good balme, to Gilead: if good wine, to Chri≈øt at the wedding of Cana: and if good tidings, to the booke of God. They did ≈øay well in many things, but neuer like this word that is from the Lord. <note place="margin">Iohn 7.46.</note> 
                  <hi>For neuer man ≈øpake like this man,</hi> as the officers told the chiefe Prie≈øtes and Phari≈øies concerning Chri≈øt. They con≈øidered the nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of death, the mi≈øeries of life, the examples of great men that had gone before them, and ≈øuch like. But what are the≈øe to tho≈øe that the word of God will ≈øhew vs; our ≈øafety in Chri≈øt, our re≈øurrection in immortality in the pre≈øence of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Gho≈øt, with ≈øuch like, yet both good vnto a ≈øanctified mind.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt the nece≈ø≈øitie of death is a true comfort again≈øt death, be it of our ≈øelues, or of our friends; no liuing fle≈øh but mu≈øt die, as we haue heard in the fir≈øt Diui≈øion. <hi>What man is hee</hi> (≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt) <hi>that liueth and ≈øhall not ≈øee death?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">P≈øal. 89.48.</note> And ≈øhall we feare that in our ≈øelues, or bewaile immoderatly that in our friends, which cannot be auoided? This were with witle≈ø≈øe wil to di≈øturbe the peace of our whole life, and with a ≈øeruile dread of the la≈øt houre, to bereaue of comfort all the re≈øt of our houres that we are to liue in this pre≈øent euill world, which in your iudgment conceiue how fond a thing it were.</p>
               <p>The carefull view of natures cour≈øe, doth ≈øhew vs degrees from age to age till we come to a full, and a like decrea≈øe by ≈øtep after ≈øtep, till we come to the change againe. Youth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth childhood, and age followeth youth by a≈ø≈øured ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitie, if we liue. But when we are children, wee feare not to be men, neither when we are men, to become olde; but many rather wi≈øh it, why then ≈øhould we either feare in our ≈øelues, or lament in our friends, death to follow age in his cour≈øe appointed, more then age to follow youth, as was ≈øaid before? Surely the one mu≈øt bee receiued as well as the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1365:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> other without choice. And whereas Chri≈øt ≈øaid in the Go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel touching man and wife, <note place="margin">Matth. 19.9.</note> 
                  <hi>What therefore God hath ioyned together, let no man put in ≈øunder,</hi> it may be more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ≈øaid of this, What God hath ioyned or coupled together no man can ≈øeparate nor put a≈øunder. And therfore a wi≈øe content both in our friends, and in our ≈øelues ≈øhall become vs be≈øt. Who will not die, let him neuer liue; for we receiue the one to endure the other when God appointeth, and we mu≈øt all die both friend and foe: to wi≈øe men nece≈ø≈øitie is a comfort, and ≈øo (I hope) to you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the mi≈øeries of this life is another head, from whence heathen men haue deriued comfort again≈øt death, be it of our ≈øelues, or of our friends. Con≈øider then with your ≈øelfe from the fir≈øt age vnto the la≈øt houre, the di≈øea≈øes incident to our bodies, to vexe vs with woe, according to their ≈øeuerall natures, ≈øome more, ≈øome le≈ø≈øe, and yet the lea≈øt too much. All the changes and chances of this mo≈øt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ≈øinfull world; whereunto, whil≈øt we liue wee mu≈øt lye open, will we nill we; from all which our death doth free vs, and our friends. Therefore how ≈øhould wee either feare or ≈øorrow for our ≈øelues or for our friends, for that which doth ≈øo befriend vs? If we conceiue hereof as we ought, we mu≈øt needs be of the ≈øame iudgment with <hi>Seneca,</hi> and in ≈øome ≈øort approoue his ≈øpeech: O men mo≈øt ignorant (≈øaith hee) of their owne mi≈øeries, who prai≈øe not death as the be≈øt inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that euer nature had, which includeth felicity, excludeth mi≈øerie, fini≈øheth the toyles of age, preuenteth the perils of youth; to many is a remedie, to ≈øome a wi≈øh, to all an end, and de≈øerueth better of none then them, to whom it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth before it be called. Yea we mu≈øt confe≈ø≈øe (the≈øe things beeing well con≈øidered) that it befalleth to men concerning death, as vnto young children concerning their friends. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children if their friends bee di≈øgui≈øed with ≈øome ≈øtrange ≈øhewes, they are afraid of them, and crying, flie from them, <note place="margin">Exod. 4.3.</note> as ≈øome that would hurt them; as <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> fled from his rod of death, when it was turned into a Serpent. But take off the≈øe
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1365:120" rendition="simple:additions"/> vizards that their friends may appeare as they are, and then by and by they are comforted and reioyce, and imbrace them gladly againe: euen ≈øo it is of death, when we are mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it appeareth vnto vs di≈øgui≈øed and couered by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth, and his approaching maketh vs ≈øhrinke, but plucke off that vizard of ≈øuppo≈øed euill, and behold it as it is to vs in Chri≈øt, and it is then but a painted death, and we ≈øee him then our great friend, that cutteth the thrid that we do weaue, and then we neither flie nor feare any more, but are truely comforted, and imbrace him mo≈øt willingly as we ought, and loue him as <hi>Ionathan</hi> loued his friend <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Sam. 18.1.</note> as his owne ≈øoule.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the heathen con≈øidered againe the famous and worthy men that died before them, and what they endured, and could not auoid; and therevpon thought great ≈øhame either to feare or flie, to lament in them≈øelues or in their friends. The greate≈øt lights that euer were among≈øt them died all; <hi>Socrates, Demo≈øthenes, Plato, Pompey, Cae≈øar, Cicero,</hi> learned, martiall, or what≈øoeuer; yea what wi≈øedome and knowledge, what valour and prowe≈ø≈øe, what act, what go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement ≈øoeuer they had, all gifts and graces, all pompe and power, all empire and maie≈øtie, were it ouer thou≈øands, or thou≈øand thou≈øands, yeelded to death, death had his place, when his time was come; and as well the≈øe great lights and loftie gallants, as the lowe≈øt wretches and poore≈øt wormes, the high okes, as the ≈ømall ≈øhrubs, drunke of deaths cuppe, when they were inuited and inioyned.</p>
               <p>Shall it not then euen in rea≈øon ≈øeeme vniu≈øt and vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, if any of le≈ø≈øe merit, yea of no merit, in compari≈øon of ≈øuch men, ≈øhall grieue for them≈øelues, or any friend of theirs to indure that which the≈øe indured. Surely not onely to grieue, but not mo≈øt willingly to welcome, what all the≈øe men imbraced, is tenderne≈ø≈øe, intolerable folly, vnfitting, and a fault no way to bee excu≈øed. Yea the fault is ≈øo much the greater, by how much either you or your friend are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the≈øe men in ≈øeruice and v≈øe vnto the common ≈øtate.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1365:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Thus did the heathens ≈øeek to ≈øalue the ≈øore which grew by death of any, and to this end many things of like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwa≈øion, they heaped vp, which I pa≈ø≈øe ouer, as ha≈øtening to the word of God, without all compari≈øon the fountaine of all comfort.

Yet for all this (≈øaith the holy Gho≈øt) <hi>Iob</hi> did not ≈øin, to wit, by rauing and railing impatiently, nor did he charge God fooli≈øhly, as dealing vniu≈øtly or cruelly with him; but con≈øidered with him≈øelfe, who had giuen, and who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and weighed with him≈øelfe that they were Gods and not his, and ≈øhould he forbid the Lord to doe with his owne what was his good plea≈øure? <hi>Is it not lawfull</hi> (≈øaith our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chri≈øt in another ca≈øe) <hi>for me to doe what I will with mine owne.</hi>

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1365:121"/> of the Lord;</hi> of which Lord? ≈øurely of this Lord that had thus dealt with him, and taken away all that euer he had.</p>
               <p>God hath not dealt thus with you, by many and many degrees with you at this time; and will you then take on, and (as it were) bid battell to the Lord, by weepings and wailings, by ≈øobbings and ≈øighings, by groanings and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by mutterings and murmurings, and by ≈øuch like te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a di≈øcontented and offended minde, aboue that which can ≈øtand with a dutifull childes behauiour to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father?

               <p>Againe, I warrant you, <hi>Iob</hi> did carefully ponder with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, what the Heathen, and ≈øtrangers to religion about him would ≈øay. If he ≈øhould be impatient and outragious, they would ≈øay, ≈øee euen thus the man that feared God, and was ≈øo religious, that he taught others, and rebuked many when they did offend, that ≈øpake ≈øo much of the Lord, and had his will ≈øo euer in his mouth, that gaue ≈øuch te≈øtimonies ≈øundry wayes to the ≈øhew of man of a reformed life, now where is all become? Now ≈øee this mans practi≈øe, how it an≈øwereth his ≈øpeeches, before he was tried; what doe we ≈øee now in him more then in many others that made not halfe the ≈øhew? Is there but ≈øo much in him, as in many Heathen that knew not his religion? Haue they not taken patiently lo≈ø≈øe of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, mothers, husbands, wiues, children and friends &amp;c. and neuer ≈øtarted at it, in compari≈øon of this man?

                  <hi>Verily I ≈øay vnto you, where≈øoeuer this Go≈øpel ≈øhal be preached in the whole world, there ≈øhall al≈øo this, that this woman hath done be told for a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of her.</hi> Euen ≈øo it may be ≈øaid touching the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the patience of <hi>Iob</hi> in this ca≈øe.

                  <hi>and haue ≈øeene the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitifull and of tender mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ca≈øe is yours at this time, in ≈øome ≈øort and mea≈øure, you haue lo≈øt a lo≈ø≈øe, and mens eyes are vpon you, you haue loued the truth, and ≈øpoken of the Lords feare before diuers; now they looke for the power of it in your ≈øelfe; and as they ≈øee you now to gouerne your affections according to the ≈øame ≈øo happily will they thinke both of Religion, and of your ≈øelfe, while they liue.</p>
               <p>Therefore plucke vp your heart in Gods name, and ≈øhew patience and comfort, and cau≈øe not the name of God to be bla≈øphemed among the wicked and irreligious, <note place="margin">Rom. 2 24.</note> through your impatience; but honor the Lord by ble≈ø≈øing his name, as <hi>Iob</hi> did honor his truth, which you profe≈ø≈øe by a godly gouernment and ≈øtay of a weake nature, and as the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he will honor you againe, as he did <hi>Iob,</hi> with mercie and compa≈ø≈øion, that ≈øhall counteruaile this lo≈ø≈øe, and farre
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1365:122"/> exceed it, for all is the Lords that you enioy, and this friend of yours was his al≈øo. He hath not taken all, but part, and left you much more then he hath taken. Both now and euer be content with his holy will, he gaue, and none but he; he hath taken, and none but he, not mine, but his own, my time was out, and the right returneth to the true owner. I may not grudge a mortall man his owne, when my time is out; much le≈ø≈øe God, my deare God, my mo≈øt mercifull Father, that yet ≈øendeth mee many mercies and comforts, though this be gone.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to your comfort con≈øider, what this holy man <hi>Iob</hi> ≈øaith againe to his impatient wife, ≈øhee rageth and ≈øtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, not onely like a weake woman, but like an vngodly woman, and comming to her husband in his greate≈øt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, increa≈øed now much more by Satans malice vpon his body, ≈øhee ≈øaid vnto him, <hi>Do≈øt thou ≈øtill retaine thy integrity?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iob 2.9.10.</note> 
                  <hi>cur≈øe God and die.</hi> To whom this ≈øweet and meeke ≈øpirited man made this an≈øwere vnto her. <hi>Thou ≈øpeake≈øt like a fooli≈øh woman, ≈øhall we receiue good at the hand of God, and not receiue euill al≈øo? Not ≈øinning yet for all this with his lips,</hi> as the holy Gho≈øt there ≈øaith, but bridling his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s, that his tongue through intemperancie did not once murmure again≈øt the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now marke, I pray you, <hi>Iobs</hi> rea≈øons to his wife: He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her that both hee and ≈øhee had, receiued many good things at Gods hand, and therfore they were bound to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ≈øuch woe as the Lord ≈øhould ≈øend, without any way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grudging or repining at the change, becau≈øe by good things, wee are bound to take wor≈øe things in good part, if the Lord doe ≈øend them. As for him≈øelfe he followeth this rule, and for the manifold mercies which he had receiued, he will now endure with willing heart and quiet minde the mi≈øery which was pre≈øent. Ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Iob,</hi> thou man of God, for thy thus doing, how ≈øweet was this argument in Gods eares, that preuailed ≈øo little with thy wayward wife?</p>
               <p>Apply this now to your owne e≈øtate, and tell me, as you
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1365:123"/> tender the truth, whether God hath not beene ≈øo good to you many waies as vnto <hi>Iob?</hi> Ca≈øt vp the bils of your receits, and call your ≈øelues to a Chri≈øtian <hi>audit,</hi> and I warrant you the <hi>≈øumma totalis</hi> will amount very high, and yet you can neuer remember the one halfe. Thinke then what <hi>Iob</hi> ≈øaid for his part, that he tooke him≈øelfe bound by the good, to endure the euill, and ≈øo if your ca≈øe be not all one, you may not gain-≈øay it; and therefore vnle≈ø≈øe you will wilfully fight again≈øt the Lords good will and plea≈øure, you mu≈øt yeeld as hee did, and in effect of words ≈øay with him. O my deare God and ble≈ø≈øed Father, God of all comfort and con≈øolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how many haue thy mercies beene vpon me, and to me? How deepe a draught haue I drunke of this ≈øweete cup of thine? Now thou ha≈øt taken one comfort from me, ≈øhall I ≈øet the one again≈øt the other, as thy ≈øeruant <hi>Iob</hi> did? <hi>Shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue good things of thine hand, and not euill?</hi> Shall I pre≈øcribe vnto thee what I will haue? O farre be it from me, I thanke thee my deare God, for thine infinit and manifold mercies, and in this change I humbly ca≈øt downe my ≈øelfe at the foot of thy Maie≈øtie, and let thy will bee done, and not mine. Lord make me content, and I am content as a weak wretch may be content. By my lo≈ø≈øe thou ha≈øt gained, and I doubt not, but that this friend of mine is remoued from mee to dwell with thee, at the which I may not grudge; many mercies I enioy ≈øtill, and they ≈øhall content and plea≈øe mee. Thus if you rea≈øon, you ≈øhall plea≈øe God, re≈øemble <hi>Iob</hi> heere before your eyes, and that eye of God that ≈øpied him, and was glorified by the patience of his ≈øeruant, he ≈øhall doe the like to you, to your great ioy and comfort. Comfort your ≈øelfe in the Lord then, after this ≈øort, and remember this ≈øpeech of <hi>Iob</hi> to his wife. <hi>Iob</hi> receiued good things, ≈øo haue you: <hi>Iob</hi> receiued euill, and ≈øo mu≈øt you; yet <hi>Iob</hi> was pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ≈øo ought you to be; which the God of patience grant vnto you.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> Thirdly, I think in this ca≈øe of the ble≈ø≈øed Apo≈øtles words, which are the≈øe. <hi>We know that all things worke together for the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1365:123"/> be≈øt to them that loue God.</hi> If the dead belonged then to God, this was be≈øt for him to be relea≈øed; and if your ≈øelfe belong to God, it is be≈øt for you al≈øo at this time to loo≈øe him; be≈øt, I ≈øay, in the wi≈ødome of God, and to ≈øome end; (although not ≈øo in your owne rea≈øon, which ≈øeeth not ≈øo farre) and in all re≈øpects be≈øt. Now thinke with your ≈øelfe thus much, if you had done good to one, and plea≈øured him much, and all the friends he hath, or any of them ≈øhould crie out for it, would it not grieue you? ≈øurely it would grieue you ≈øo much the more, by how much that vnthankefull di≈ølike ≈øhould be more vehement and la≈øt long. So it is with God; and therefore ≈øee what you doe, and whom you moue to anger. The Apo≈øtles words are plaine, <hi>All things worke for the be≈øt vnto them that feare God:</hi> if you beleue it, and al≈øo thinke of your dead friend and your ≈øelfe: God the holy Gho≈øt (who cannot lye) concludeth that the ≈øame was be≈øt both for him and you, which now is come to pa≈ø≈øe.</p>
               <p>When good is done, we ≈øhould not grieue, and when the be≈øt is done, much le≈ø≈øe ≈øhould we grieue; for God calleth him out of this life, when he is at his be≈øt, if he be good, that hee turne not to euill; if euill, that hee waxe not wor≈øe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then with ≈øorrow and ≈øowre lookes, and let the Lord for his mercie, receiue your thankes, from faithfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and not murmuring and repining from vnbridled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: not onely good is done, but the be≈øt, euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be≈øt, by the be≈øt that onely knowes what is be≈øt; and it ≈øhould appea≈øe and ≈øatisfie you: God is no lyer, neither can he be deceiued, but if one houres life might haue been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either for him or you, then is not the be≈øt done; and then the Apo≈øtles words are not true; but that were wicked once to imagine ≈øo. Therefore no longer life would haue profited him or you, but the very be≈øt is done; ble≈ø≈øed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be God for his goodne≈ø≈øe euer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I con≈øider what the ≈øame Apo≈øtle ≈øaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>I de≈øire to be loo≈øed and to be with Chri≈øt,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1.23.</note> 
                  <hi>which is be≈øt of all.</hi> And I aske of you, whether your ≈øelfe do not the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1365:124"/> like, as you are able; if you doe not, you are yet ouer earthly, and further in loue with this wicked and ≈øinfull world then you ≈øhould be. If you doe it, why then grieue you that your friend hath obtained that which you de≈øire? this will ≈øeeme rather enuie then loue in you to conceiue di≈ølike for ones well doing. What, againe if your friend wi≈øh as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle doth, long before he obtained his reque≈øt, and now the Lord hath granted, what he ≈øo heartily wi≈øhed? this is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to be reioyced for, and not any mi≈øerie to bee wept for. A true friend acknowledgeth a debt for the plea≈øuring of his friend, and is not mooued with anger or griefe for the ≈øame: ≈øtay then your teares, if you will bee iudged a friend, and neither grudge to God the companie of his child, nor to the child the pre≈øence of his God, becau≈øe this is wicked. Thinke of the glorie, company, immortalitie, and ioy, and comfort with the ble≈ø≈øed Trinity, and all the ho≈øte of heauen, that now your friend enioyeth, thinke of the woes and mi≈øeries in this wretched vale of teares, from which he is freed, and then iudge you if the Apo≈øtle ≈øay not true, that it is be≈øt to be loo≈øed and to be with Chri≈øt. If this be≈øt bee now at this in≈øtant fallen to your good friend by Gods good mercie, ble≈ø≈øe God for it, and comfort your ≈øelf, that your friend enioyeth ≈øuch endle≈ø≈øe ioy and comfort; and thereby ≈øhall you ≈øhew your ≈øelfe a friend indeed, and all that are godly and wi≈øe cannot but thinke well of you. Againe, the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.6.8.</note> 
                  <hi>That we know, that while≈øt wee are at home in the bodie, we are ab≈øent from the Lord: therefore we loue rather to remoue out of the bodie, and to dwell with the Lord.</hi> From which ab≈øence from God your friend is freed, and by pre≈øence and dwelling with God he is now ble≈ø≈øed; a true cau≈øe, and a great cau≈øe (as hath beene ≈øaid) of good content. Then doe not you prouoke the Lord with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull teares, ≈øighes, and groanes, but ≈øtay that cour≈øe which offendeth greatly; and tread the ≈øteppes of all ≈øuch as vpon the like occa≈øion haue walked rightly by their di≈øcreet mourning. Who are euer patient and moderate in ≈øorrow,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1365:124"/> repre≈ø≈øing and ruling their affections, and gaue them not a loo≈øe reine, and ≈øo ought you. Againe, in the fir≈øt Epi≈øtle to the The≈ø≈øalonians, it is ≈øaid; <hi>I would not haue you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that ≈øleepe, that yee ≈øorrow not,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. The≈ø≈ø. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>as they which haue no hope.</hi> Reade the place, and examine your owne cour≈øe, whether you hope or no. Fir≈øt, that your friend is well, and then, that Almightie God will ≈øupply his want to you ≈øome other way: for both the≈øe are nece≈ø≈øarie; our friends are our comforts if they be good. But if I tie God to them, and thinke all is gone when they are gone, where is my hope? what plea≈øure to God, ≈øo to tru≈øt in him, that I tru≈øt more in my friends, and cry out when they goe? how ≈øhall I doe? how ≈øhall I liue? what ioy can I now haue? Is this hope? is this tru≈øt? is this faith? fie, that euer affections and pa≈ø≈øions ≈øhould carie any good child of God ≈øo far from his dutie, and from true knowledge. I ≈øay againe, our friends are our comfort, while the Lord lendeth them, and when our friend returneth to his earth, yet the Lord is in heauen, where he euer was, (if I haue lo≈øt my father) to be my father, mother, ≈øi≈øter, friend, yea all in all to me, what≈øoeuer I want. Therefore while he liueth, which is and ≈øhall bee for euer, I cannot be friendle≈ø≈øe, though my friends die or depart from me, but that either for one, he will rai≈øe me vp another, or him≈øelfe ≈øupplie the place which is be≈øt of all. Mourne not then I pray you as one without hope, but hearken vnto the Apo≈øtle, and ≈øhew foorth your faith, hope, and obedience vnto God, to the glorie of God and your owne prai≈øe.</p>
               <p>Againe, wee read in the booke of Leuiticus, <note place="margin">Leuit. 10.3.</note> that the ≈øonnes of <hi>Aaron, Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were ≈ølaine by the Lord in his anger, for their ≈øinnefull pre≈øumption in offering vp ≈øtrange fire, which the Lord commanded them not, which was a fearefull ≈øight and ≈øpectacle to the fathers eyes, to ≈øee two ≈øonnes at once, and in ≈øuch ≈øort dead. Yet what did <hi>Aaron;</hi> I pray you marke the text, <hi>I will ≈øaith the Lord bee ≈øanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron</hi> (≈øaith the holy Gho≈øt there) <hi>held
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1365:125"/> his peace.</hi> And what an example is this, if any thing may mooue you to ≈øtay your affections for the death of your friends. Againe, it is ≈øaid in the booke of the Reuelation, <hi>And I heard a voyce from heauen,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reu. 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>≈øaying vnto me, Write, Ble≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea</hi> (≈øaith the Spirit) <hi>that they may re≈øt from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> Your friend is dead in the Lord, and therefore ble≈ø≈øed: will you then weepe and lament for him? his workes follow him, and the Lord in mercie hath crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his obedience, according to his promi≈øe, and will you looke awry at it? God forbid. Againe, con≈øider with your ≈øelfe that your friends walk with God, and are gone to their heauenly Father in peace, they are gathered vnto their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they are not dead, but ≈øleepe, and their fle≈øh re≈øteth in hope, they are gone the way of all fle≈øh, and doe now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the face of God in heauen, and what cau≈øe of ≈øorrow is this to any friend that loueth them? If your friend were di≈øcharged and relea≈øed out of pri≈øon and mi≈øerie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the palace of an earthly prince, and to his Court, to his great and exceeding ioy and content, would you ≈øhewe your loue and contentment toward him in bewailing the ≈øame? how much le≈ø≈øe then ≈øhould you lament his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into Gods euerla≈øting Court and kingdome, to his vn≈øpeakable ioy and comfort?</p>
               <p>Thus may you gather many places of holy Scripture, and on this ≈øort meditate on them. For ≈øweet is the word of God again≈øt all ≈øorrowes and griefes, and by name again≈øt this.</p>
               <p>But it may happily be obiected, it is your child that is dead, and it died before it could well be baptized, this grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me more then otherwi≈øe it would, and ≈øo you feare your childs e≈øtate.</p>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:1365:125"/> but is the Sacrament, the ≈øeale, the ≈øigne, the badge of them that are Chri≈øtians before. Be≈øides it is not the want of the Sacrament, that depriueth a man of Gods fauour: for the children of the I≈øraelites were not circumci≈øed all tho≈øe fortie yeeres which they liued in the wilderne≈ø≈øe: the rea≈øon whereof was, becau≈øe they were euer to remoue and iourney when≈øoeuer the pillar of the cloud that was their guide, a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended and went forward, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.18, &amp;c. ≈øo that they were alwaies to attend vpon the cloude both night and day, not knowing when it would remooue; and therefore could not circumci≈øe their children in the wilderne≈ø≈øe, as yee may read, <hi>Io≈øh.</hi> 5.2, &amp;c. but it is the contemning or de≈øpi≈øing of the Sacrament, that depriueth men of Gods fauour when they make no more account of it, then <hi>E≈øau</hi> did of his birth-right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.32. then <hi>Ahaz</hi> did of the Lords helpe, <hi>E≈øay</hi> 7. and it is al≈øo the neglecting of it, when God offereth time and opportunitie that we might haue it.

                  <hi>An≈øwer.</hi> True it is, that the lo≈ø≈øe is great in re≈øpect of the world, but what is that if we con≈øider God; God is al≈øo able to ≈øupplie all that, ≈øome other way, if we take it well. This is apparant, that what good or preferment could haue come
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:1365:126"/> to him any way or to his friends, if he had liued, the Lord for ≈øome purpo≈øe as yet happily hidden, hath preuented: but yet his arme is not ≈øhortened, as I ≈øaid, to doe vs good ≈øome other way, but it might perhaps prooue otherwi≈øe contrarie to our expectation, if he had liued longer, and then it would haue beene a great griefe vnto vs. But admit that it would haue beene as you hope if he had liued longer, yet he is more highly preferred euen to the highe≈øt heauens, and to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of God, and this no earthly preferment can match. And except we be wholy earthly our ≈øelues, we cannot but ≈øauour this, and not let his youth grieue vs, for no youth nor age is too good for God, when he is plea≈øed to take them.</p>
               <p>A foole or a child ≈øeeing a goodly clu≈øter of grapes, thinketh it pitie to put them into the pre≈ø≈øe to deface them, but he that is wi≈øe knoweth that thereby the liquour which is in them is pre≈øerued, and that this timely gathering is a meanes to keepe them from corruption. So we thinke ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, Oh, it is great pitie ≈øuch a one ≈øhould die ≈øo ≈øoone, ≈øo towardly a youth, ≈øo good a creature can hardly be ≈øpared; but God in his wi≈øedome knoweth it to be good. And if he cut off the life of that good and godly king <hi>Io≈øiah,</hi> as it were in the middle of the ≈øtemme, <note place="margin">2.

If you will be ruled to weigh things with rea≈øon, you may well ≈øee mercie euen in this timely death; for many are the perils both of bodie and ≈øoule, that young men auoid when they are taken hence, fal≈øe doctrine, here≈øies, errours, and many grieuous ≈øinnes, wounding the very con≈øcience with a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting worme that euer gnaweth; publike calamities, and ruine of ≈øtate, many priuate mi≈øeries great and grieuous, which no man can thinke of beforehand, more bitter to good men then any death: from all which this happie deliuerance in time of youth doth free your child, and ≈øet him ≈øafe, that you ≈øhall neuer mourne with him, nor for him that way. And herein we haue <hi>Dauid</hi> an example of godly fortitude, who hauing a child ≈øicke, did while it liued afflict his ≈øoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øought

His ≈øorrow ended, when he once ≈øaw there was no hope of enioying any longer the companie of his child. Now this cour≈øe ≈øeemed vnto his ≈øeruants a new and ≈øtrange kind of Philo≈øophie, that he ≈øhold mourn in the danger of death, and yet reioice, or at lea≈øt comfort him≈øelfe with any content in death. And therefore his ≈øeruants ≈øaid vnto him, <hi>What thing is this that thou ha≈øt done,</hi>

                  <hi>thou didde≈øt fa≈øt and weepe for the child while it was aliue, but now he is dead thou doe≈øt ari≈øe and eate meat.</hi> And what rea≈øon had hee for this ≈øtrange and vnwonted behauiour? He ≈øaid, <hi>While the child was aliue I fa≈øted and wept, for I ≈øayd, Who can tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will haue mercie on me, that the child may liue, but now being dead, wherefore ≈øhall I fa≈øt?

And thereupon he comforted his heart, and would not continue in heauin≈ø≈øe for that which could not bee helped. So that it is to a right vnder≈øtanding man, ground inough to build content and quietne≈ø≈øe of heart vpon, that God hath done his worke which thy ≈øorrow cannot reuoke. But peraduenture it will be here obiected, that afterward when <hi>Dauid</hi> heard of his ≈øonne <hi>Ab≈øolons</hi> death, hee did ≈øo greatly lament and bewaile the ≈øame, that hee would in no ≈øort bee comforted quite contrarie to that which before hee practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; for it is ≈øaid that <hi>he was much mooued,</hi>

                  <hi>and went vp to the chamber ouer the gate, and wept as he went ≈øaying. O my ≈øonne</hi>

               <p>For the an≈øwering of this obiection, and your better ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction herein, wee are to vnder≈øtand that <hi>Dauid</hi> knew that he had a wicked and rebellious ≈øonne, of the e≈øtate of who≈øe ≈øaluation he had great cau≈øe to doubt, becau≈øe he died in rebellion, which indeed may ≈øeeme to bee the principall cau≈øe of his exceeding ≈øorrow and lamentation, and not ≈øo much for the death of his ≈øonne, as for that cau≈øe. But of his childe he beleeued that he died in the ≈øtate of grace, and ≈øo was made partaker of ≈øaluation, which was the cau≈øe that he was comforted pre≈øently after his death, ≈øaying, that his ≈øon ≈øhould not returne, but that he him≈øelfe ≈øhould goe to him. Euen ≈øo in like manner, if we feare the e≈øtate of our childe or friend that is dead, then indeed haue wee great cau≈øe to weepe, mourne and lament for him, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did heere for <hi>Ab≈øolon:</hi> but if we haue no ≈øuch feare, and do hope well and the be≈øt of the e≈øtate of our childe or friend; then mu≈øt wee with <hi>Dauid</hi> comfort our ≈øelues, and ≈øay, <hi>But now he is dead, wherefore ≈øhould I fa≈øt and weepe? can I bring him back againe, I ≈øhall goe to him, but he ≈øhall not returne to me.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now in the meane while, till we can haue our de≈øire in this ca≈øe accompli≈øhed, <note place="margin">Rom. 6.12.</note> wee mu≈øt re≈øi≈øt and ≈øtriue again≈øt our ≈øinnes, that they may not raigne in our mortall bodies; and let all our endeauor and care increa≈øe again≈øt our ≈øins, that the force of them may be dayly weakened, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber le≈ø≈øened, and all occa≈øions of ≈øinning auoyded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is lawfull to de≈øire death, in re≈øpect of the mi≈øeries, calamities and troubles of this life; and for the preuenting of the mi≈øeries to come. And yet this holy de≈øire mu≈øt not be ≈øimple and ab≈øolute, but it mu≈øt bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained with certain re≈øpects, and with the≈øe re≈øeruations. Fir≈øt, it mu≈øt bee de≈øired ≈øo farre forth, as it is a meanes to put an end to all our mi≈øeries, to all the dangers of this life, to all the corruption of nature, and to the nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Secondly, as it is a gate by which wee enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the immediate fellow≈øhip with Chri≈øt and of God. And our de≈øire al≈øo for the≈øe endes mu≈øt keepe it ≈øelfe within the≈øe limits; wherein two Caueats mu≈øt bee ob≈øerued: Fir≈øt, it mu≈øt not bee immoderate, exceeding the golden meane; Secondly, it mu≈øt alwayes be with a re≈øeruation of Gods good plea≈øure, and with an humble ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and ≈øubiection of our willes to the will of God. For if ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the≈øe be wanting, the de≈øire of death is defectiue, faulty and dangerous. Death frees vs from the mi≈øeries and perils of this world, aboli≈øheth all pre≈øent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1365:145"/> all future dangers, and brings vs to be with Chri≈øt.

And la≈øtly, what man hauing the reuer≈øion of a goodly kingdome, would be loath to receyue the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it? And ≈øure wee are all in this ca≈øe by rea≈øon of the manifold mi≈øeries incident to vs in this world; that wee haue good cau≈øe to wi≈øh with a holy de≈øire to be loo≈øed from al the≈øe mi≈øeries, and to be with our Sauiour Chri≈øt, and in the meane time, <note place="margin">Luk. 21.19.</note> till we can haue our de≈øire in this ca≈øe, <hi>Let patience po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øe our ≈øoules.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, and la≈øtly it is lawfull to de≈øire death for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting and full accompli≈øhment of that coniunction and vnion which wee haue in Chri≈øt Ie≈øus our head, that wee might be where he is to enioy his pre≈øence. <hi>For we are</hi> (≈øaith the Apo≈øtle) <hi>members of his body, of his fle≈øh,</hi>

               <p>And this coniunction and vnion which wee haue in Chri≈øt, is al≈øo ≈øet downe in that heauenly prayer, which our Sauiour Chri≈øt made vnto God his Father, at his la≈øt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well out of this world immediately before his pa≈ø≈øion and ≈øuffering; <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> where hee prayeth at large for the accompli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this vnion in vs with him.
